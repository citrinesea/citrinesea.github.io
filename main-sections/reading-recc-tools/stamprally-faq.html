<p><b>citrinesea Stamp Rally Information Page</b></p></div>

<span style="color: #344744; font-size: 16px;"><p>Welcome to the stamp rally page! This event is meant to celebrate each AKARYUSEI Engstars event that occurs. By reading four stories related to a given center event, current producers and producers new to AKARYUSEI alike can have fun! You do not need to be an AKARYUSEI P to participate!</p>

<p>Stamp rally announcements are hosted on <b>@citrinestamps</b>. If you have any questions not answered on the FAQ, feel free to ask them on the <b>retrospring</b>.</p></span>

<div class="labelcategory">
	<p><b>How do I take part in the event?</b></p></div>
	<span style="color: #344744; font-size: 16px;"><p>As an AKARYUSEI event is in progress in ENGstars, you will read four recommended stories I've chosen. These stories are related to the focus-character and have varying lengths. Before the event, all stories will be unknown. I will reveal each story as the event progresses.</p>
	<p>After you read the revealed story, you will fill out your story progress in the pinned Story Progress Google Poll. This tells me that you completed the task. I will then update your stamp sheet.</p>
    <p> For this reason, event correspondence is very DM heavy, so make sure that you have your DMs open so that I can message you. All DMs will come from @citrinestamps.</p></span>

	<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p></div>

	<span style="color: #344744; font-size: 16px;"><p><b>Do I have to read stories when they come out?</b></p>
	<p>Nope! You can read them as I release them, you can wait until they're all revealed, and anything in between. As long as it's before the end of the last event day, reading stories is at your pace.</p></span>

	<span style="color: #344744; font-size: 16px;"><p><b>What if I've already read the stories?</b></p>
	<p>You don't need to reread them if you don't want to, but in the spirit of the event, consider revisiting them! Either way, track your progress in the form.</p></span>
