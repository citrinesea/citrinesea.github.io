</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Whew… To have a good cup of tea while looking at beautiful flowers in full bloom... It truly is the highest luxury.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>It's so rare to have such sunny, good weather on a winter day like this. I feel like I'm in good shape.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Hehe, I can't help but want to sing……
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><div class="inner-monologue"><p>(Cough, cough)

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Eichi.... Why not enjoy the tea in moderation and go inside?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Yumenosaki Academy is built on a hill facing the ocean. Being exposed to the sea breeze must be harsh on your body.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Can you stand? If you can't, I'll give you a ride on my shoulders! Come now, please don't hesitate~☆

<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>I wish you’d stop treating me like a child. I mean, I'm the same height as you. If you carry me on your shoulders, won't you collapse?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>That might be so. If this were Himegimi, I could easily cuddle him in my arms, but carrying Eichi would likely be too difficult!
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Well, clowns make the impossible possible. There's nothing I can't do...☆
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>I think “clowns” are meant to entertain people. Although in your case, Wataru, I think you’re more of a "magician" than a clown.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>My selling point is my versatility! Please refer to me as both "clown" and "magician”...♪
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Good grief, I never get bored when I talk to you, Wataru. It’s like having the fun of an amusement park at the palm of your hand~♪
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Oh? Have you ever been to an amusement park, Eichi? Fufufu, they’re like a wonderland...☆
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>No matter how old they are, adults can forget time and have fun like the children they used to be. That is what makes them a wonderland.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Oh? I think you and amusement parks are a perfect match, actually. Isn't it easy to entertain children with your jack-of-all-trades talent?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Fufufu. You say delightful things, don’t you...☆
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Sometimes strict, sometimes sweet. I can only sing my praises of your ability to juggle the carrot and stick so adeptly!
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Perhaps that’s why I can't leave His Majesty the Emperor’s side.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Could it be that you even had the skills of a beast-tamer on hand in order to keep me in one place, Eichi?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Were you a beast? A clown, a magician, and a beast on top of that. I’m impressed.

</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>

<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>I’d rather you don’t treat me like I’m sick, but… (cough, cough)... I really haven't been able to stop coughing for a while now.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>I'm going to go inside and warm up.

</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>

<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Mm, that person over there is Anzu-chan. She doesn’t seem to be feeling well. Maybe something happened?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Fufufu. Even though you’re the Emperor, you're still human. Or are you sweet on Anzu-san because she’s close to you?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>She <i>did</i> break down this school and rebuild it, after all. Well, I can't say it's a complete job, but she’s still coming along well.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Is it that strange that such a presence weighs on my mind?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>No. Anzu-san is also the person who made love bloom in the unfeeling, dull Hokuto-kun.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Even if it’s not to the extent as His Majesty the Emperor, Anzu-san intrigues me too…♪
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Anzu-chan’s also liked by an unexpected person now, hm? Is that another one of her talents?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>In any case, we don't have the option of just leaving it be. Anzu-chan, would you like to come over here and have some tea with us?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>…Hmm, I guess she didn't hear me. At this rate, she’ll just keep on her path.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>In that case, I'll stop her in her tracks! Just watch! <i>Un, deux, trois...☆</i>
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>My, what a clever idea to put roses out on the path to stop her. It’s because you can produce that many roses in an instant that I can’t help but think you can even use magic~♪
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>It’s the highest honor to receive such praise! Come, Anzu-san. Can you see me? You do now, good!
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Would you like some nice, warm tea? It's a hot drink that will fill you up and stave away the cold. … You bought tea from a vending machine?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>But the weather is so cold, it sinks into your bones. There'd be nothing worse to have than cold tea.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>We have hot tea and scones laid out here~♪
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Oh? The scones got a reaction out of you. Anzu-san, do you like clotted cream?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>If so, let's add cream! Do you like jam? Then let’s add some jam, too!
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Fufufu. It'll be a little tea party in no time! Come now, eat up~☆
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Oh dear, my job was taken away from me. Well, the tea that Wataru brews is quite delicious, so it's okay.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Whew... It's so tasty it envelops all your senses. I’d like him to join the “Tea Club” with talent like that.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>WATARU</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>Though I’m known to be versatile, I can't split myself to be in many places at once. Although, I suppose it's not impossible if you master it.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="wataru"><p>If it came down to it, I’d just have to set up a body double...☆
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>I can never tell how serious you are. Oh, I'm sorry, Anzu-chan.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Even though I forced you to stop, it’s just me and Wataru speaking. That must be dull.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>It looked like you were troubled about something, so I stopped you to speak with you.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Heheh, are you holding back, by any chance? I heard that you asked Kiryu-kun from AKATSUKI to give you pointers on how to make costumes.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>I’m not saying to treat me like I’m Kiryu-kun, but I'd be happy if you could open your heart to me a little, as well.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="eichi"><p>Thank you, Anzu-chan. Well then, could you tell me right away...?

<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>The fact that Hasumi-senpai gives you the time of day, it’s so respectable~♪
</p></div>

</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>You decided on the theme of the program after asking your seniors at fine, so you don't mind...? I’m happy to hear it!
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>Hmhm. An opera taking place around the latter half of the Meiji era. That's such a typical act for AKATSUKI, I’m pumped~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>It was good that you decided on a performance, but then you realized there weren't enough people and panicked. Anzu-anego’s so scatterbrained~
</p></div>

</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>I’m really grateful to be a member of RYUSEITAI now, from the very bottom of my heart. So, I’ve got no complaints there.

<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>I’m sure Hibiki could do the job on his own, but I'd like to see at least one other person in the role of Tsujigiri.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Kiryu said the same thing as me? Hmm. So we had the same thought, huh. Let me think of someone from my side...
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>What? Kiryu said that too? I don't mean to think that much like him…
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>But we both belong to the same unit. Maybe we’ve grown to have similar trains of thought.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Anyway, I'll think about this as well, but Opera is a DreamFes that you’re to plan and run. In the end, your decision is what takes precedence.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of person you choose, Producer.

</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>So there’s no way I’d be the only one casted out!! After all, I'm Tsuki… <i>Tsuki</i>...?

<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Crap—?! Was I so obsessed with writing my masterpiece that I lost even my sense of self?
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Where are we!? Who am I? AaaaAAAH!! I can't remember anything...!!
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>… Tsukinaga Leo? That's right, that's the name! That was close, I almost lost my identity there...☆
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Thank you, Anzu. I knew it'd be right to ask you!!
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>I guess I was right when I said, “If you have any trouble, ask Anzu“...☆

<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Ah, yeah, this is my notebook. Look, it says here, “If you have any trouble, ask Anzu”.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Before this, I wrote it like, “Because she’s everywhere”, but even when I called or yelled your name, you wouldn’t show up~?

<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Eh? How did I know?

<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>That's why I wanted to participate, too, so I made a lot of plans. So far, this is the first one!

<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>The second one? You're looking for someone to play the role of Tsujigiri, right?

</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="leo"><p>Now we have all the characters! The opera, the action drama begins...☆ I can't stop, because my imagination is the whole universe!

<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> Tetora refers to Kuro as 大将 (taishou, lit. high-ranking general ), or boss. Not to be confused with Chiaki's 隊長 (taichou).</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> There's a similar line in <a href="https://310mc.github.io/tough_guy/#We-the-Rough-and-Tough-8" target="_ blank">Tough Guy</a> about Kuro's forgetfulness. Cute!</p>

<a href="#100">[10]</a> Souma says the same thing in <a href="https://citrinesea.github.io/main-sections/translations/Event-Stories/Scroll-of-the-Elements/scrolls-s1.html#chapter-1" target="_ blank">Scroll of the Elements</a>. We love callbacks!</p>

Souma's running gag is regularly resorting to performing seppuku to make up for trouble. 切腹 (seppuku or harakiri, lit. belly-cutting ) was a form of ritualistic suicide samurai used for a variety of reasons. For Souma, that tends to be shame.</p>
