</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>It's finally the day of Scroll of the Elements! I got too excited again and woke up too early!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>You arrived early too, huh? I’m always really impressed with how early you come to work ♪

</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, you finally noticed me. Ehehe, good morning～♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Yes! Look, look here at this sculpture of Frog-san!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>The sign said you could climb on and take photos, so I decided to go for a ride~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Please spare me from any scolding about how it’s embarrassing that I’m doing this as a high schooler, okay? This was a dream of mine, so please take a photo~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote" id="11"><p>Peace ☆ Don’t I look like Jiraiya<sup><a href="#1"><b>(1)</b></a></sup>? <i>Ninpou: Toad Technique</i>~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote" id="22"><p>Anzu-dono, I’d like you to play Orochimaru or Tsunade! — Eh, don't you know about the three-way stalemate<sup><a href="#2"><b>(2)</b></a></sup>? Orochimaru has the snake and Tsunade has the slug~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Huh? "Be careful not to lose your balance and fall into the pond?"
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Don't look down on me, I'm a <i>ninja!</i> Our main selling point is our agility...♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>However, just in case... It would be bad if I got injured, or got wet and caught a cold before Scroll of the Elements.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I will disembark from the statue. Farewell, Frog-san~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Hup–! Once again, good morning! Anzu-dono, thank you for your hard work~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote" id="33"><p>Hm? What’s wrong? Why are you moving so strangely? Ooh, wait, are you hand-signing a jutsu<sup><a href="#3"><b>(3)</b></a></sup>?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>What? “Let me hug you...?” W-Why? Have you caught on to Taichou-dono’s hugging habit, Anzu-dono?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>G-Gh–!? Hey, don't forcibly hug me! It hurts!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Hmm. Anzu-dono, your parents and younger brother will be away this weekend, so you’re feeling lonely, huh...
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>You’ve been busy with work lately, so you don’t have much contact with your family...?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I’m sorry to hear that…
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Anzu-dono is a producer, so you must be much busier than me.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>And although spending time with family is important, you can't neglect your work... I can guess that’s frustrating for you.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I understand; for me, in the past… until I entered Yumenosaki Academy, I pretty much stayed home all the time.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Lately, I've been going outdoors more often, which makes my family lonely.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>So every time I go home,  my parents come running towards me, saying “Shinobu~! Shinobu~!” ♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Since I was a child, I’ve always been the odd-one-out who loved ninjas...
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I’d always act and talk like a ninja, too. It worried my parents, as I didn't have any friends for a long time either.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I know they can't help but be overprotective, but it’s frustrating being treated as a child who can't do anything.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I’m already a teenager by now.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Anzu-dono. I'm glad you're kind to me, but I'm not a stuffed animal.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>And I’m not your little brother either, you know…?

<div class="keitoquote"><p>Right now, I’m putting together different key points that I couldn’t fit in the pamphlet.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I’m thinking of making flyers of that information, and handing copies of it out for free, but...
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Rather than just listing it out, I figured it would be easier to read it in manga form where Hanzoumon explains the information.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Considering that a lot of families with children come to this tourist spot.

<div class="keitoquote"><p>However, I only have a faint recollection of its design, so I want to draw it while looking at the real thing.

</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>TETORA</b>

<div class="tetoraquote"><p>Maybe it’s ‘cause there’s a different sense of distance when it comes to someone your age, and someone who’s your junior?

<a href="#11">[1]</a> Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki, or Jiraiya (<i>lit. "Young Thunder"</i>) is the protagonist of the Japanese folk tale The Tale of Gallant Jiraiya. He's heavily associated with toads, and is often depicted riding a giant toad. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiraiya" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
<p id="2">
<a href="#22">[2]</a> In the same folktale, Tsunade is a young maiden who learns slug magic. Orochimaru is a robber who posesses snake magic. The relationship between Jiraiya (toad), Tsunade (slug) and Orochimaru (snake) is like rock-paper-scissors. Snake fears slug, slug fears toad, toad fears snake.

<p id="4">
<a href="#44">[4]</a> From 特殊撮影技術 (<i>lit. special effects technology</i>), 特撮 (tokusatsu) refers to live-action films or TV-shows that use heavy special effects (SFX). One well known SFX tactic is the use of miniature sets or scale models. Subgenres of tokusatsu include kaiju  (i.e., Godzilla), superheroes (i.e., Kamen Rider or Power Rangers), and mecha. It's kind of Chiaki's whole life. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu" target="_blank"><b>here</b></p>

<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> 赤備え (Akazonae <i>lit. red arms</i> ) is a military organization from the Sengoku period to the Edo period.
