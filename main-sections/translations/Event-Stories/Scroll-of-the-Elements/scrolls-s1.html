<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>Alright. For the most part, it’s coming together.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>The name of the DreamFes is “Scroll of the Elements”, and it’ll be a joint live performance between RYUSEITAI and AKATSUKI.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>The theme is “ninjas”. It seems they want to do a tie-in with a movie if possible. 
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>Due to copyright issues, we can’t really use movie lines verbatim, but...
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>Well, design-wise, we should keep to the theme as best we can.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>The performance doesn’t need to be a musical-esque narrative either.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>Regardless, I'm sure fans of the movie will come to see it, so I'd like to take the initiative to incorporate its trademark lines.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>The DreamFes venue is a tourist spot that recreates the world of period dramas. It gets used for movie shootings, too.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>Additionally, the sponsor will be the event organizers at the site.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>The organizers have the personnel and know-how to manage stage production, so we can just give our input and leave it to them. Hasumi and I will handle the negotiations.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>The purpose of the live show is to attract tourists to the venue and promote newly opened attractions and facilities.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>Admission will be free. It seems that the profit will come from limited-edition merchandise.
</p></div>
<div class="quote" id="chiaki"><p>I’ll leave the preparation of goods and the like to Anzu. It’s her specialty, and she seems to have connections.
</p></div>

<p><b>TL NOTES</b></p>
<p id="1">
<a href="#11">[1]</a> Souma refers to Kanata as 部長 (buchou, <i>lit. chief</i> ), or club president (Kanata's position in their club).</p>
<p id="2">
<a href="#22">[2]</a> Kanata's dialogue is completely in hiragana, likely to emphasize his slow, relaxed way of speaking. Some words are in quotation marks likely due to Japanese being difficult to read in full hiragana (it would be like reading English sentences without spaces between words).</p>
<p id="3">
<a href="#33">[3]</a> An influential leader from the 6th-7th centuries, Prince Shotoku is credited with modernizing government administration. He is also considered foundational for the spread of Buddhism in Japan. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Sh%C5%8Dtoku" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p id="4">
<a href="#44">[4]</a> From 緩い (loose, laid-back) + マスコットキャラクタ (mascot character), ゆるキャラ (yuruchara) are Japanese mascots. Yuru-chara are typically made to resemble and promote specific places, events or businesses. Their designs tend to be cute and sloppy. It's kind of Midori's whole life. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuru-chara" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p id="5">
<a href="#55">[5]</a> A famous Sengoku-era ninja. Hanzou served Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of Japan's three Great Unifiers. If you read <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/verdantcrimson/736381807458664449/heaven-and-earth-prologue" target="_blank">AKATSUKI Climax</a>, you might recognize that name. Read more about Hanzou <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanz%C5%8D" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> In Japanese, foreign words from other languages (such as English) are rendered in katakana (the alphabet typically for spelling foreign words). However, when Souma uses katakana words, they are all written in hiragana instead, likely to emphasize how he struggles with foreign words. These words are kept as written in hiragana, and put in "quotes".</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> いい子 いい子 ("good kid, good kid") often includes head patting. There will be a lot of this.</p>
<p id="8">
<a href="#88">[8]</a> Tetora refers to Kuro as 大将  (taishou, <i>lit. large general</i> ), or boss. Not to be confused with Chiaki's 隊長 (taichou).</p>
<p id="9">
<a href="#99">[9]</a> This is likely about Kuro's work with Knights Killers, a temporary unit put together by Leo Tsukinaga. <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/The_King%27s_Horseback_Ride" target="_blank">The story</a> they appear in also happens during autumn.</p></div>
