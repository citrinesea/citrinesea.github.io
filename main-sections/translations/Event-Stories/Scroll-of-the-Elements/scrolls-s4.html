<p><b>TL NOTES</b></p>
<p id="1">
<a href="#11">[1]</a> A reference to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Festival" target="_blank">Pirate Festival</a>.</p>
<p id="2">
<a href="#22">[2]</a> It was more of the word of legends that ninjas would use kites for espionage, but they were used in ancient China for military purposes, among others. Kites were introduced from China to Japan in the seventh century. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-lifting_kite">here</a>.</p>
<p id="3">
<a href="#33">[3]</a> 起承転結 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu" target="_blank">kishoutenketsu</a>) describes the structure of a narrative. In order, 起句 (kiku) is the introduction of characters and context, 承句 (sho) is the development of the story towards 転句 (ten) the twist, where the story takes an unexpected development, and finally 落ち (ketsu) the conclusion. 序破急 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo-ha-ky%C5%AB" target="_blank">johakyu</a>) refers to the speed at which events happen. It's typically applied to tea ceremonies, marital arts, or theatre, but I thought the speed of music would better represent what he's talking about.</p>
<p id="4">
<a href="#44">[4]</a> This resembles his <a href="https://310mc.github.io/es_scout_quotes/" target="_blank">5* Scout quote</a> from !-era.</p>
<p id="5">
<a href="#55">[5]</a> RYUSEITAI (流星隊) means "shooting star squadron", so the comet imagery has to do with that.</p>
<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> He's referring to himself, the Eccentrics, and the events of <a href="https://310mc.github.io/meteor_impact/" target="_blank">Meteor Impact</a>. He uses the word ばけもの (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obake#:~:text=A%20bakemono's%20true%20form%20may,Shinto%20and%20other%20animistic%20traditions." target="_blank">bakemono</a>), which were supernatural creatures that could shapeshift.</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> 武士道 (Bushido), or the "way of the warrior", is the moral code of samurai which dictate the way they carry about their lives. Historically, there were several different codes and practices that samurai would follow, but Bushido can be used as a catch-all for the variety of  them. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here, Souma says "Bushido spirit". As <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g00665/bushido-an-ethical-and-spiritual-foundation-in-japan.html" target="_blank">Kazuhiko Kazuha summarizes</a> from a book on Bushido, the 5th Scroll of Kashoki (by samurai Saito Chikamori, 1642) is the first known description of bushido spirit:</p>
<p><i>The essence of Bushidō is: do not lie, do not be insincere, do not be obsequious, do not be superficial, do not be greedy, do not be rude, do not be boastful, do not be arrogant, do not slander, do not be unfaithful, be on good terms with comrades, do not be overly concerned with events, show concern for one another, be compassionate, with a strong sense of duty. Being a good samurai takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one's life.</i></p> 
<p>This set of notes is credited with spreading the concept and influence of bushido spirit to the common population, rather than warriors, and was written in kana to make it more accessible. Miyamoto Musashi, someone Souma mentioned in <a href="../../Idol-Stories/samurai-and-ninjas.html" target="_blank">Samurai and Ninjas</a>, is said to exemplify what it means to live in accordance with bushido.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's what Souma means by Bushido or Japanese spirit</p>
<p id="8">
<a href="#88">[8]</a> Here, Shinobu uses 僕 (boku), a common masculine first-person pronoun, to refer to his old self. Shinobu's first-person pronoun is typically 拙者 (sessha, <i>lit. clumsy person</i> ), an archaic pronoun ninjas used. This whole line comes back in !!-era for <a href="https://310mc.github.io/dear_me_before_i_became_a_ninja/" target="_blank">Shinobu's Feature Scout</a> story.</p>
<p id="9">
<a href="#99">[9]</a> Souma finishes Shinobu's line. The full saying is from an Edo-era <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodoitsu" target="_blank">dodoitsu</a> poem: "People who meddle in other's love affairs will get kicked by a horse".</p>
<p id="10">
<a href="#100">[10]</a> In the original Japanese text, Chiaki says this same line to AKATSUKI when they reunite in <a href="https://310mc.github.io/submarine/ruthless_battlefield/#Chapter-3">Submarine</a>. Cute.</p>
<p id="111">
<a href="#1111">[11]</a> A shogi reference.</p>
<p id="122">
<a href="#1222">[12]</a> A ninja saying. The kanji for 忍 (ninja) is comprised of a 刃 (blade) on a 心 (heart). Conceptually, the two together represents the act of perserverence: even if there's a blade over their heart, they will get through. Now that's commitment to the bit.
