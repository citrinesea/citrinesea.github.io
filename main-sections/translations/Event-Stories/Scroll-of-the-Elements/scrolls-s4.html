</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>An unprecedented gamble, where anything can happen— AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI, a collaboration seen only in dreams! The curtain rises, and Scroll of the Elements is about to begin...!

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>“It's the Age of Warring States, the era of rival factions… A small, peaceful and quiet country lies nestled in the cool shade of a mountain pass. Here, seeing the world is beyond one’s wildest dreams. Here, a strange incident has occurred.”
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>“An impregnable mountain castle, protected by natural fortresses. Every day, the security guards sit cross-legged on its sturdy ground, careless with their duties. Taking advantage of those negligent security guards…”
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>“A suspicious shadow is trying to sneak in.”
</p></div>

<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Ohh... As expected of Sengoku, you’re living up to the name of a Broadcasting Committee member. You speak quite fluently, with confidence.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Your tone is easy and clear to the ears… What a pleasant voice to listen to.)

</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Although, there are also period dramas where they do peace signs, so…?)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(As long as the message gets across, then it’s fine. Noh and Kabuki use archaic words, so they aren’t able to convey even half of the fun for people without prior knowledge.)

<div class="soumaquote"><p>(The traditional performing arts may be like that, but…)
</p></div>

<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Conveying that charm, making it shine as my weapon… That's how I intend to spend this fleeting life.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Without throwing out the antiques, we will give them flesh and blood, inherit them, channel them! It's the same for sumo, kendo, traditional Japanese dance, tea ceremonies, and that of course means ninjas, as well!)

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(I’ve spent half my life being constantly scolded by everyone, who told me to do something more constructive— something more realistic.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(I had been told that, instead of spending all my pocket money and buying shuriken or something, I should invest in my future—)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(That it’s more meaningful to memorize mathematical formulas, chemical symbols, and kanji than to memorize tons of ninja names—)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(And that's actually true. Everyone's opinions are proper and correct.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(But… just because everyone is right doesn't mean I'm wrong.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Everyone is different, everyone is good. That is what my comrades RYUSEITAI told me — and alongside them, I will put together a performance for the sake of adding beauty to the stage—)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Thinking about it, I’ve accumulated so much training thus far, until it has gotten me here.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(That thought makes me feel rather satisfied and proud of myself.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(No. To the me from when I hadn’t yet started speaking like a ninja would...)
</p></div>

<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Is that so? In that case, I have nothing else to say here. Samurai and ninja are the same; anything you could say to a man with an expression like that is only wasted breath.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Let's at least treat each other with sincerity.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Now, like usual... Let's fulfill our duty, ninja of RYUSEITAI.)

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(We each hold our own forms of justice up high.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Kamen Rider and Super Sentai, Showa Rider and Heisei Rider... heroes of American comic book movies, too—)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(When all of them meet, they have conflicting opinions and clash. However, in the end, they join forces to fight a common enemy. That is the staple of these shows.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Even if the place of birth is different, even if the color of justice is different—)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(We are surely aiming for the same thing! I will believe in that, and continue to fight in the name of love and peace today and onwards..☆)

</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>“♪～♪～♪”
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Now, it’s the “kuraimakusu”. The ninjas persistently try to steal the scroll. Even when they slip up and get caught, they manage to free themselves…)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(The ninjas run about, evading traps as they escape.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(We samurai are exhausted, though. Why do we have to work so hard to hide the evidence of our master's affair…?)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Those sorts of thoughts start to get us a little irritated.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(On the way to the scroll, there was a rampage at a sake brewery, and alcohol was spilled. Everyone became inebriated and started feeling tipsy.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(So they held a party… and while complaining about their masters, the ninjas and samurai somehow got along well in their excitement.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(In such a cheerful atmosphere, the sound of conch shells resounds, calling for war.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(That's right... All of it was a scheme plotted by a neighboring country. They watched like tigers, waiting to attack the castle as soon as the opportunity presented itself.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(They filled the wife’s head with words of the lord’s infidelity, cultivating her suspicion.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(They prompted internal strife by splitting the castle in half.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(They must have thought that if things went well, ninjas hired by his furious wife would simply assassinate the lord.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Even if it didn’t go that far, internal disputes would cause turmoil in the castle…)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(And because the ninjas had dismantled all of the traps and defenses, the castle is easier to attack.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Thus, the national power was to be reduced due to the scheme, and the castle’s military strength to be further reduced with the infighting...)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(The castle was to be overrun by the army of the neighboring country — to have approached before we knew it.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(However, well… the ninjas were so inept, that time had passed without any proper results...)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(The army of the neighboring country couldn’t stand it anymore, and so that’s why they began their attack.)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(However, the castle was disturbed to some extent, causing confusion...)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(And while normally, it might have been possible to push through with momentum and take control of the castle…)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(A miscalculation occurs at that moment. In fact, if the castle lord truly <i>was</i> having an affair...)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Then there was a possibility that the wife, who would not listen to any excuse… would have had her entire force, which was half of the castle, defect against the lord.)
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Mm. The lord of the neighboring country seemed to be especially enamored with this castle lord’s wife...)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(It seems like he was planning to make this lord’s wife his own if things went well. That's why he told her about her husband's infidelity.)
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(However, our lord was not having an affair. The scroll that was sealed in the secret room of the castle tower… The scroll that he had stubbornly tried to hide…)
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(It was filled with a plethora of love poems written about his wife. A massive amount...)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(It seemed that he didn't want people to see them, so in his embarrassment, he tried to hide it.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(After he reported this, the wife regrets suspecting his affair. The love between the lord and his wife deepened, and their vassals, ninjas and samurai, celebrated it with great joy.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(The only hindrance left is the approach of the neighboring country’s army. The marauders who meddle with the happy ending — the <i>love</i> of a close couple…)

</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(It’s a spectacular, legitimate performance of battle that vastly overshadows everything up to this point, that it makes you wonder “why were they acting so incompetent earlier, then?”)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(It's turning out as one would expect, but that's just the staple of historical dramas!)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(Making good use of the traps that had harassed them up until this point, and having fought each other, the ninjas and samurai rampage perfectly in sync!)
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>(But the enemy is strong, and we are exhausted. One by one... My comrades fall, but I won’t back down!)

</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(There are only a few survivors from both the ninjas and samurai. Kanzaki-dono is fighting tooth-and-nail, but he won't be able to defeat the vast army by himself.)

</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(I’ll take that task on. I will sneak into the enemy camp unseen and cut off the head of the general.)

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(If we defeat the leader, the enemy's army will either collapse or, at the very least, retreat. It will be our victory.)
</p></div>

</p></div>

</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Yet I have a place to belong now, given to me by everyone in RYUSEITAI.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(They allowed me to openly shout that I like the things I like.)
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(And then welcomed me as a comrade. They let me spend my youth with them laughing, crying, and getting angry together.)
</p></div>

<p><b>TL NOTES</b></p>
<p id="1">
<a href="#11">[1]</a> A reference to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Festival" target="_blank">Pirate Festival</a>.</p>
<p id="2">
<a href="#22">[2]</a> It was more of the word of legends that ninjas would use kites for espionage, but they were used in ancient China for military purposes, among others. Kites were introduced from China to Japan in the seventh century. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-lifting_kite">here</a>.</p>
<p id="3">
<a href="#33">[3]</a> 起承転結 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu" target="_blank">kishoutenketsu</a>) describes the structure of a narrative. In order, 起句 (kiku) is the introduction of characters and context, 承句 (sho) is the development of the story towards 転句 (ten) the twist, where the story takes an unexpected development, and finally 落ち (ketsu) the conclusion. 序破急 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo-ha-ky%C5%AB" target="_blank">johakyu</a>) refers to the speed at which events happen. It's typically applied to tea ceremonies, marital arts, or theatre, but I thought the speed of music would better represent what he's talking about.</p>
<p id="4">
<a href="#44">[4]</a> This resembles his <a href="https://310mc.github.io/es_scout_quotes/" target="_blank">5* Scout quote</a> from !-era.</p>
<p id="5">
<a href="#55">[5]</a> RYUSEITAI (流星隊) means "shooting star squadron", so the comet imagery has to do with that.</p>
<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> He's referring to himself, the Eccentrics, and the events of <a href="https://310mc.github.io/meteor_impact/" target="_blank">Meteor Impact</a>. He uses the word ばけもの (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obake#:~:text=A%20bakemono's%20true%20form%20may,Shinto%20and%20other%20animistic%20traditions." target="_blank">bakemono</a>), which were supernatural creatures that could shapeshift.</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> 武士道 (Bushido), or the "way of the warrior", is the moral code of samurai which dictate the way they carry about their lives. Historically, there were several different codes and practices that samurai would follow, but Bushido can be used as a catch-all for the variety of  them. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here, Souma says "Bushido spirit". As <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g00665/bushido-an-ethical-and-spiritual-foundation-in-japan.html" target="_blank">Kazuhiko Kazuha summarizes</a> from a book on Bushido, the 5th Scroll of Kashoki (by samurai Saito Chikamori, 1642) is the first known description of bushido spirit:</p>
<p><i>The essence of Bushidō is: do not lie, do not be insincere, do not be obsequious, do not be superficial, do not be greedy, do not be rude, do not be boastful, do not be arrogant, do not slander, do not be unfaithful, be on good terms with comrades, do not be overly concerned with events, show concern for one another, be compassionate, with a strong sense of duty. Being a good samurai takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one's life.</i></p> 
<p>This set of notes is credited with spreading the concept and influence of bushido spirit to the common population, rather than warriors, and was written in kana to make it more accessible. Miyamoto Musashi, someone Souma mentioned in <a href="../../Idol-Stories/samurai-and-ninjas.html" target="_blank">Samurai and Ninjas</a>, is said to exemplify what it means to live in accordance with bushido.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's what Souma means by Bushido or Japanese spirit</p>
<p id="8">
<a href="#88">[8]</a> Here, Shinobu uses 僕 (boku), a common masculine first-person pronoun, to refer to his old self. Shinobu's first-person pronoun is typically 拙者 (sessha, <i>lit. clumsy person</i> ), an archaic pronoun ninjas used. This whole line comes back in !!-era for <a href="https://310mc.github.io/dear_me_before_i_became_a_ninja/" target="_blank">Shinobu's Feature Scout</a> story.</p>
<p id="9">
<a href="#99">[9]</a> Souma finishes Shinobu's line. The full saying is from an Edo-era <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodoitsu" target="_blank">dodoitsu</a> poem: "People who meddle in other's love affairs will get kicked by a horse".</p>
<p id="10">
<a href="#100">[10]</a> In the original Japanese text, Chiaki says this same line to AKATSUKI when they reunite in <a href="https://310mc.github.io/submarine/ruthless_battlefield/#Chapter-3">Submarine</a>. Cute.</p>
<p id="111">
<a href="#1111">[11]</a> A shogi reference.</p>
<p id="122">
<a href="#1222">[12]</a> A ninja saying. The kanji for 忍 (ninja) is comprised of a 刀 (knife) on a 心 (heart). Conceptually, the two together represents the act of perserverence: even if there's a blade over their heart, they will get through. Now that's commitment to the bit.
