<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Gentlemen, excellent work! Ah, that’s too insolent of me to say, when I am still only a novice… I’ll say “thank you for your hard work” instead～♪
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Come now, enjoy the food to your heart's content.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>The food used in the banquet scene is authentic. It would be a waste to let it rot and throw it away, so I was told they’d like us to finish it up.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I hurried to get some additional food and drinks, so let's have a quick kick-off and enjoy ourselves~♪
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Oh, by the way, we have permission to have a wrap party here.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>The sponsors were very happy that Scroll of the Elements was a great success~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>How are you so energetic, Kanzaki...? I'm already exhausted.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>It was a slapstick comedy this time around, so my face hurts from overusing facial muscles that don’t typically get practice.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Yeah, what he said. My face got so stiff that it isn’t goin’ back to normal...
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>This time, the focus was on sword-fighting and action scenes. Kanzaki and I are fine for the most part, but Hasumi-no-danna, are you feelin’ groggy from it all?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Don’t look down on me. I don't want to hold you guys back, so I go on runs to train.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>It feels good to run early in the morning. I can feel the change of seasons, too.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>That makes you sound like a grandpa…
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Well done to everyone in RYUSEITAI, too. We were in sync way more than I expected, and it was pretty fun. Let's perform together again~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>I should be the one to say that to you guys. We got to experience something extremely valuable, and thanks to you all, Scroll of the Elements was made possible.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Thank you for making my comrade’s dreams come true.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Hmph. It's still autumn, it would be bad if you burnt out here.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>The organizers said that if things keep going like this, they would like to consider holding additional performances or releasing a second round... There may also be an opportunity to do a similar live in the future.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>I’m looking forward to it~ Next time, I want to play the role of “Samurai-san”, too~
</p></div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>The other day, Souma taught me how to use a “katana”~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It’s risky to let Buchou-dono handle blades, so I’d rather he doesn’t, but…
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I've grown a little interested in ninjas, too. Why don't you teach me the basics next time, Sengoku?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Zzz… zzz…~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Ahaha. Yet on stage, or rather, in the final scene, he looked so powerful and cool.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>(Ossu! I’m overwhelmed with emotion that I was able to join forces with Taishou~! ♪)
</p></div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>He actually <i>genuinely</i> managed to pass through the ring of fire. It was a real surprise to see.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>He really is light on his feet, huh... Tetora-kun is very athletic, too — I feel like I’m the only one who looks like a dunce...
</p></div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>Maybe I'm lanky because I only eat vegetables… I need to take in more protein...
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Oh, you got so inspired by your comrades that it made you wish to grow stronger!? Takamine is a boy too, huh~ That feeling is important!
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>That’s wonderful, keep encouraging each other to improve yourselves, you guys...☆
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>Wait— please don't cling to me... Right after performances, Morisawa-senpai’s body-temperature is about three times higher than normal, and it’s <i>so</i> stuffy...
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>It’s fine, isn’t it? Let’s get along! Let's share our happiness!
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Now that Sengoku has done what he wants to do, it might be Takamine's turn next, y’know? Is there anything you want to do?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>Uu~... Right now, I just want to go home and sleep in bed...
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>What a silly comedy this is, like Manjuu Kowai. That’s all from me. I’ll take my leave now, so onto the next speaker.
</p></div>

<div class="locationquote"><b>★ Castle Tower Stage</b></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>… Anzu-dono, you’re a little far away for some reason, but…
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>You should come closer. Look, the chestnut yokan is delicious~♪
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>…You have such a sad look on your face. What’s the matter? If you’d like, you can talk to me.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>We’re “kurasumeito”, I want you to rely on me anytime~♪
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm. You feel disappointed in yourself because you misjudged what distance to take with us “aidoru”?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Sengoku told you that he was neither a stuffed animal nor a younger brother... And you feel bad about that?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I think Sengoku said that simply because he wanted to be treated as a man, though.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Just doting on someone isn't enough to satisfy that.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It’s a difficult problem, isn’t it? We have our respective positions, but we’re human beings with flesh and blood. We aren’t mature enough to completely separate work and private life.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>A novice like me can’t quite find the words to say something haughty, but... We are humans, Anzu-dono. You will inevitably make mistakes, over and over again.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>However, in this modern age, it isn’t such a suffocating era that even a single mistake cannot be forgiven until after one’s death...
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It’s alright to make many mistakes many times over, and to regret them just as much. After all, the most important thing is not to repeat them again, correct?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>In hopes that next time nobody will get hurt — That hopefully, you can come closer to crafting a better future…
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>You have no choice but to put in the effort, reflect on yourself, and fumble your way forward. Fortunately, in this modern age... For kids like us, there is a “next time” waiting for us.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>We were born in a happy era, not in the harsh Sengoku period — a period where, if you stole nothing but a handful of rice, your hands would be cut off, or you would be killed... 
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>As long as we’re allowed to make mistakes, and until the moment we use up all of my "next times"... there is nothing we can do but to make every effort we can until we become adults.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Carrying sins, mistakes, and scars, we have no choice but to grow so that we won't repeat them again.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm? Ahh, I’m simply echoing something Hasumi-dono said. He told me something like that when we first met...
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>There was something about it that really touched me, and that is why I'm still by his side to this day.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>That person has made mistakes and failed many times, but he still does all he can to keep moving forward. I'm sure it's the same for Kiryu-dono.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>That’s exactly why I want to serve and honor my seniors.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>… Sorry, I wanted to listen to your worries, Anzu-dono, but I only ended up talking about myself.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>But, well, understanding us “aidoru” to a deep level is never a waste for a “prodyusaa”.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Anzu-dono. I want you to smile. Everyone will worry if you look so gloomy. Plenty of our “kurasumeito” are nosey.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Let’s go back to where everyone is. If you feel anxious, I will protect you. You have an attendant by your side.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>To be frank… Out of AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI, I’m the only second-year.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>If Anzu-dono weren’t here with me, I’d constantly have to grapple with being stuck between my juniors and seniors. Ha ha ha~♪

<a href="#33">[3]</a> 起承転結 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu" target="_blank">kishoutenketsu</a>) describes the structure of a narrative. In order, 起句 (kiku) is the introduction of characters and context, 承句 (sho) is the development of the story towards 転句 (ten) the twist, where the story takes an unexpected development, and finally 落ち (ketsu) the conclusion. 序破急 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo-ha-ky%C5%AB" target="_blank">johakyu</a>) refers to the speed at which events happen. It's typically applied to tea ceremonies, marital arts, or theatre, but I thought the speed of music would better represent what he's talking about.</p>
