<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>… Alright. We cut it close, but the flyer is completed. All we have to do is send the data, check with the person in charge, and leave printing and distribution to staff.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>I don’t really get it, but thanks for your hard work. Now we just have to wait for Kanzaki to arrive. I wonder what he’s doing…
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I don’t know. It is extremely troubling being unable to contact him, so I’d wish he’d get into the habit of using his cellphone already...
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>He always has needlessly long items hanging off of him, and yet he doesn’t carry any digital devices.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Well, when I contacted his parents, it seems that he’d already left home a while ago, so… I think he’ll be able to make it in time for rehearsal.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Still, it feels like it’s getting a little too late. I’m worried. I hope he hasn’t gotten into an accident…
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Calm down, danna. He’s not a toddler taking his first steps or somethin’. You’d be lookin’ down on him, being so overprotective.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>If something happened, he’d probably call you from a public phone or something or the other.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Leave that aside for now — Let’s do costume fitting, and go over the script again.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>How does the costume feel? Is it difficult to move in? I’ll fix it up a bit if it is.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>No problems at all. It’s so comfortable, I’d want to wear it everyday.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I’m impressed with how unique the script is without interfering too much with the content from the tie-in movie. It’s littered with interesting elements.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Yeah, the costumes, script and stage were all prepared by the staff.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Sure enough, you can learn a lot from professional work. Look at the beauty of these seams~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>You’re in unusually good spirits, Kiryu.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>… I heard that while I was busy, you’ve been charging into various “B1” matches like you were challenging rival dojos. But, well, it seems like it was a nice break for you.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>I won’t do anything reckless, so don’t worry. I’m not gonna cause any trouble for AKATSUKI or the student council.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>I’m in a position of authority now, so I can’t be a naughty kid.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I know. No, I trust you. I’m sorry for putting you in such an inconvenient position, Kiryu.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>I’m not a brat, y’know, I agreed to it. I don’t think of myself as inconvenienced or tied down.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Adult freedom is freedom as long as it doesn’t hurt the public.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Instead of getting wasted and going on a tear at a coming-of-age ceremony... Having a glass of beer after a long bath at the end of a hard day's work is probably more precious.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>… You don't drink alcohol, do you?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>I’m drunk almost every day, even without the use of alcohol, y’know. ...Oh, it looks like that Kanzaki guy finally arrived after waiting forever, huh?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Eh, where? Mm… my eyesight might have gotten worse again.

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hasumi-donooooo! Kiryu-donooooo! I apologize for arriving late…!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Kanzaki Souma has arrived, please forgive my rudeness! To atone for being late, I will disembowel myself on the cross!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>A HOOORSE?!
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>K-... K-K… Kanzaki?! You— a-aah— even I can’t find the words for this—!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>What’s wrong, Hasumi-dono! Calm down, please; we are at one’s palace!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you nervous before the big stage? So Hasumi-dono also has a novice side to him~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>O-Oi, Kanzaki? Stop for a sec, don’t just rush in without pause?!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Ah—! Once more, please forgive me!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>This horse and I were in such harmony, I had forgotten that I was still riding! Ha-ha-ha☆
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Kanzaki… For now, dismount that horse, and sit seiza there.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Huh? Hmm... I guess you're angry at me for being late, Hasumi-dono.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Your anger is understandable. I will slit open my stomach promptly, then. I will leave the beheading to you~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Don't commit seppuku so easily. I’ve always wondered this about you, but from what era did you time-travel from?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Well, you see, hahaha... The hands on my family’s clock have stopped since the Edo period.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Have your parents been pestering you  or something? It seems your relatives aren't very fond of idol activities...
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>And so, they didn’t pay for transportation, giving you no choice but to take a horse?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Ah, no. After a long period of convincing, my father and mother are finally showing some understanding.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono, and Anzu-dono have all visited my home many times and spoke for me to them, after all.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>They can feel your sincerity. Besides, my parents aren't <i>that</i> antiquated. Some relatives still wear bitterness on their faces, though.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I was the one who knocked on the door of Yumenosaki Academy with the desire to become an “aidoru”.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>No matter what anyone says, and no matter what hardships I may be given, my feelings will not change.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>But if it's a nuisance for AKATSUKI and everyone else... I have no choice but to apologize.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>When have I ever said you’re a nuisance? Well, it is a bit of a bother, but... If you’re a proper man, follow through on your original intention.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>If you desire the world, then grasp it for yourself. Kiryu and I will always be on your side.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Ahaha, I don't want something so ambitious, but...
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>As a samurai warrior who attends Hasumi-dono and Kiryu-dono, I’m committed to not being a disgrace at the very least.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>By the way, this horse is owned by our family. His name is Saigodon.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>As far as I’m concerned, we’re like brothers who grew up running around the mountains and fields together.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Apparently they're going to use him for movie filming, so... my parents told me that if we were going to the same destination, I could ride him here.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>And since I thought it would be faster than walking, I mounted him.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>However, in the end, I wound up getting stuck in traffic and almost being late. Modern Japan is not very suitable for traveling by horse.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I've always been telling you to choose a more modern mode of transportation.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Well, even if it can't be helped this time, from now on, you'll meet up with me or Kiryu first and then head to the site.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm, understood~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>You’re only ever good at responses, aren't you...?

<div class="soumaquote"><p>Look, Saigodon. It’s my seniors, say hello~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Eeep, don't lick me! Can't you see, I'm already dressed and have my makeup done!
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>You too, er… Saigodon? After you’ve safely delivered him, go get changed!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm. There's no need to be so scared, Hasumi-dono.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Saigodon is an excellent horse trained in acting. He can purposefully fall down in ways that don’t hurt his rider.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I’m not really scared, but big creatures have a sense of intimidation that threatens our survival instincts.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>When I was young, and I misbehaved, I would get locked in a room lined with giant Buddha statues. Frankly, it was traumatic.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Well, that’s odd. Aren’t you on good terms with the huge Kiryu-dono?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>I can talk, can’t I? Danna’s eloquent, but he’ll have trouble speaking with things that don’t speak back.
</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>There, there, there... He’s bein’ real obedient, huh? What a very clever horse~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Um, everyone~? It’s gotten noisy for some reason, but has Kanzaki-dono arrived?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>If that's the case, I'd like to do a rehearsal of the performance shortly~?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>— Is that a horse?! Wow, it really feels like I’ve traveled back in time to the Sengoku period~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hm, a <b>scoundrel</b>! I jest… Sengoku’s completely a ninja now~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I've been a ninja from the beginning, haven't I~? Hehe, this is a real ninja costume made by a professional who works on period dramas!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Well, it's a stage costume, so it's also flashy and colorful~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you not concerned about historical research or authenticity, Sengoku?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Well, if you wanted to be authentic, ninjas rarely wore “ninja outfits” to begin with.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Since they were intelligence operatives, it was normal for ninjas to blend in with the crowd by disguising themselves as townspeople or monks.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>In order to adapt to modern times, there is a certain degree of symbolization... characterization that’s needed.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I admired ninjas not because of how they looked, but because of their way of life~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Is that right? Sengoku is remarkable, he really has an eye for discerning the true nature of things...♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>…~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Huh? What is it, Hasumi-dono? Why are you looking at me so pleasantly?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Well, Kanzaki acting like a senior is rare, so it's just interesting...
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Alright, stop the chatter and go change your clothes. We, AKATSUKI, cannot neglect our role of being the perfect example. 
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Kanzaki, I'll help you get dressed. I wanna do the finishing touches to your hair and makeup myself.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm, I’m grateful. Only with Kiryu-dono’s consideration are we complete as AKATSUKI.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>But before that, I'm going to deliver the Saigodon to the movie set, so please excuse me for a moment~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Kanzaki-dono~, I want to ride the horse, too~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Sengoku, sometimes you unexpectedly say things like a toddler. Alright, get on, get on.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It’ll be light enough if it’s only you. Don’t shout, or you’ll frighten Saigodon.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Understood! Wow, I’ve always dreamed of riding a horse~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>

<div class="keitoquote"><p>Oi, wait a minute. Sengoku, your stage clothes will get dirty…
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Gallop, gallop ♪ Hi-ho, Saigodon!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Haha, now it's not a historical drama, but a Western one...♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Ah, they’ve gone off, how incorrigible. Our juniors are a little too free-spirited.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Haha. As long as it's the kind of freedom that doesn’t cause trouble to others, it's fine. Us seniors can save strictness for when it’s needed.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>……
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>

<div class="kuroquote"><p>Whoa, you startled me. Morisawa, what’s wrong? Your complexion doesn’t look good?
</p></div>

<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>

<div class="keitoquote"><p>Hah? Don't touch the <b>koi</b> in that river, they cost millions of yen.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Hasumi’s dumbassery aside, Morisawa, why are you sayin’ things straight out of a shoujo manga. Get it together, this is outta character for you.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>Sorry, Taishou. Taichou’s been actin’ strange for a while now.
</p></div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>There was some kinda weird misunderstanding when he saw Sengoku-kun and Anzu-anego hugging each other.
</p></div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>As they said themselves, it's the same as when you hug Midori-kun and stuff, Taichou.
</p></div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>It’s just <b>skinship</b>. It’s not love or anything, right?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Mmngh… I know, but it was so shocking, even I’m surprised by my reaction…
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Right, Anzu’s a girl… And we’re all healthy high school students…
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Even if it were a millionth of a chance, there’s still a possibility it could happen. I didn't take that into consideration, even though being an ally of justice means preparing for all kinds of situations.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>This time it was a misunderstanding, but someday it might not be a joke. I have to start thinking about what to do if that were to happen…
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Ugh, but I'm not good at topics like this!
</p></div>

</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>Hey, you can’t slack off when you’re the one who always acts big and tells me to concentrate…
</p></div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>And besides… you always try to solve everything yourself…
</p></div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>But nobody ever asked you to do that… How many times do I have to tell you not to carry the burden all by yourself...?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>That's right ~ “Helping when nobody ever asked” may be the hero's “duty”, but Chiaki is no longer “alone”, right?

<div class="kanataquote"><p>I’m here, and so is everyone else. The five of us together are “RYUSEITAI”.
