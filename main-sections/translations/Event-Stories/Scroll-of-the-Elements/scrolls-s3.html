<p><b>TL NOTES</b></p>
<p id="0">
<a href="#00">[0]</a> Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, <i>lit. master</i> ), or "boss". He'll also use Hasumi-no-danna.</p>
<p id="1">
<a href="#11">[1]</a> 道場破り (dojoyaburi, <i>lit. dojo storming</i> ). In martial arts, this is when someone visits rival martial arts schools and challenges its members to assert dominance over whose technique is better. If the dojo lost, its apprentices would abandon it for the winner's school. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojoyaburi" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p id="2">
<a href="#22">[2]</a> If you're new to AKATSUKI stories, Souma's running gag is regularly resorting to performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku" target="_blank">seppuku</a> to make up for trouble. 切腹 (seppuku or harakiri, <i>lit. belly-cutting</i> ) was a form of ritualistic suicide samurai used for a variety of reasons. For Souma, that tends to be shame. Here, Souma got a little creative and threatened 十字割腹 (juuji kappuku).</p>
<p id="3">
<a href="#33">[3]</a> 人馬一体 (jinba ittai, <i>lit. person + horse + one body/unity</i> ) is an idiom in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yojijukugo#Idiomatic_yojijukugo" target="_blank">four-character compound</a> form.</p>
<p id="4">
<a href="#44">[4]</a> 正座  (seiza, <i>lit. proper sitting</i> ) is a formal, traditional way of sitting, commonly used in martial arts, tea-ceremony, etc. It was developed among samurai in the Edo period. Its difficult to maintain for long periods of time, so Keito's using it as both a punishment, and a manner of getting Souma to sit still so he can lecture him. It's also a way for Souma to convey his respect. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p id="5">
<a href="#55">[5]</a> 介錯 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaishakunin?oldid=451567052" target="_blank">kaishaku</a>) is a secondary role to the act of seppuku. An appointed second person beheads the one who has committed seppuku to spare them from prolonged anguish. This is typically reserved for samurai who choose seppuku for the sake of honor, rather than shame.</p>
<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> Another four-character compound, 時代錯誤 (jidai sakugo, <i>lit. age, era + error, mistake</i> ),  meaning anachronism, or a person/thing that seems to belong to a different time period</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> The Sengoku period (戦国時代) is the backdrop for Scroll of the Elements, Shinobu and Souma's characters as a whole: for starters, it's a homonym for Shinobu's last name 仙石 (sengoku).</p> 
<p>Also known as the Warring States period (15-16<sup>th</sup> centuries), Japan's landscape was defined by constant civil wars and upheavals, as various samurai clans fought for control of the country. Ninja became prominent during the Sengoku period, with the emergence of <a href="https://www.tokyocreative.jp/en/blog-history-of-the-ninja" target="_blank">two major ninja clans</a>. This period ended with the unification of Japan, by Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period" target="_blank">here</a>, and if you don't want to read about it, here's the <a href="https://youtu.be/Mh5LY4Mz15o?si=b9liuEvazUvSnYAt&t=165" target="_blank">History of Japan</a> version (2:35-3:35). </p>
<p id="8">
<a href="#88">[8]</a> A callback to their first meeting, in the <a href="../../Idol-Stories/samurai-and-ninjas.html" target="_blank">Samurai and Ninjas</a> idol story</p>
<p id="9">
<a href="#99">[9]</a> Chiaki used the word 恋 (koi) for romantic love. Keito thought he said 鯉 (koi), the fish.</p>
<p id="10">
<a href="#100">[10]</a> スキンシップ (wordplay on skin and kinship) is the general idea that people socially bond through physical skin-to-skin contact, especially family and loved ones. It also applies to spending time together naked, like at bathhouses, where more general groups of people like coworkers or classmates platonically bond.</p>
