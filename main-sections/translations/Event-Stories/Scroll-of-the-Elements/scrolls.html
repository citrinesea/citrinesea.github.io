<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote" id="22"><p>Mm? Oh, Sengoku. You're full of energy as always. However, though it’s said that children will run even on a windy day<sup><a href="#2"><b>(2)</b></a></sup>, you shouldn’t run in the hallway.</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>

</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Fufu, in the eyes of the world, high school students are still considered children. And whether you are an adult or a child, you must refrain from actions that cause trouble to others.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hasumi-dono always scolds me for that, too.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Look. The papers I was carrying were swept away by the wind, thanks to you rushing in.</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>

</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Huh? Ah, no, I didn’t have anything in particular! It’s just that when I saw you, Kanzaki-dono, I got so happy that I ran up to you~</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>What, are you a puppy? However, I'm happy that you’ve become attached to me, as I don’t have much of a relationship with the underclassmen.</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Kanzaki-dono, it’s hard to approach you because you always walk around with a sword hanging at your side. You’re also a member of AKATSUKI, the student council’s headlining unit…</p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>It’s absolutely because of things like that that everyone perceives you as an intimidating person.</p></div>  

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you also scared of me, Sengoku…?</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote" id="33"><p>Not at all! I used to think you were a menacing person, but when I talked to you, I realized you were really kind!<sup><a href="#3"><b>(3)</b></a></sup></p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, but is it going to be too annoying if I get too friendly?!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>That won’t happen. Let’s continue to get along… Sengoku ♪
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>At any rate, Sengoku, are you free right now? Hasumi-dono asked me to put up these “posutaa” on the bulletin board.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>However, I’m having a difficult time with the amount. I’d appreciate your help.</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote" id="44"><p>That’s an easy task~! RYUSEITAI has just finished a big job<sup><a href="#4"><b>(4)</b></a></sup> and is currently on a break, so I have plenty of free time!</p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote" id="55"><p>Surprisingly, our unit’s Taichou-dono<sup><a href="#5"><b>(5)</b></a></sup> gives us plenty of good rest~♪</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It is the same for me. We are both blessed with good masters, aren’t we?</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>AKATSUKI is also on break.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>The “Harouin Paatii” S1 will be held soon, you see. Hasumi-dono, or rather the student council, has been extremely busy preparing for it.</p></div> 
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It's not to the point where he’s immobile, but it would be troubling if he were to push himself and deteriorate his health.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Therefore, I'm helping out with student council errands in hopes of getting Hasumi-dono the freedom to move a little.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>The current bustling of the student council is Hasumi-dono’s own personal matters, so…</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Kiryu-dono and I have been told that we can take on individual work in the meantime, or unit work as only the two of us.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>However, I feel that in doing so, we’d march on ahead without him. It makes me feel shameful. Could it be because I lack independence?</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, I also have a lot of free time when RYUSEITAI isn’t active. We’re similar after all~♪</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Is that right? Well, ninjas and warriors might be similar in the eyes of the public, I suppose, but....
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>…Hm? Forgive me, Anzu-dono. I was about to kick you. Why are you kneeling here?</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you feeling unwell? Are you okay? Should I take you to the infirmary?</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Now, now, Anzu-dono. Don't bully Sengoku too much, Buddha is watching.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hm. Anzu-dono has been asked to do various projects, but has hit a wall...
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>You came to see the “posutaa'' on the bulletin board in case they had anything useful to reference?
</p></div> 
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Certainly, there are often “B1” notices, announcements and recruitment listings posted on this particular bulletin board.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>There are so many that it would be futile to try peeling them all off, and they would just be put back up again. Even Hasumi-dono is overlooking it at this point.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Actually, the other day, we AKATSUKI participated in the “B1” Quarrel Festival...
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>We’re not in a position where we can openly regulate “B1”s anymore.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>If we were to criticize someone for participating, and they were to criticize us for having done the same, we wouldn’t be able to refute it.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>But a lively atmosphere is a good thing, so I suppose it's a mixed blessing.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>…Huh? What's wrong, Anzu-dono? Do I have something on my face?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm, “Are you interested in period dramas”...? Does it seem like I am?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>It does, Kanzaki-dono. Moreso, you come off as the kind of cringey guy who likes period dramas and samurai so much that he wears a sword just for the sake of it.</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote" id="77"><p>Is that right…? Then let me explain just in case, but I have government authorization to wear a sword<sup><a href="#7"><b>(7)</b></a></sup>! Look, look, my license~♪

<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>The government? Who exactly are you, Kanzaki-dono…?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Anyway, what were you saying about period dramas, Producer-dono?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I like them and watch them often~!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>In period dramas, ninjas are usually minor roles or one-off fighters, so I end up a little dissatisfied with their portrayal.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Eh? If there was a period drama that featured ninjas in the spotlight, would I want to appear in it?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I-Is there a proposal out there that looks like it was prepared just for me!?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>If that's the case, I definitely want to appear! I won't let anyone else have it because it's my <i>dream!</i>

<p><b>TL NOTES</b></p>
<p id="1">
<a href="#11">[1]</a> -殿 (-dono) is an honorific that roughly means "lord" or "master". It's archaic, which gives Souma and Shinobu an old-timey feel.</p>
<p id="2">
<a href="#22">[2]</a> A proverb from the Edo period. The full proverb is "Children are children of the wind (children will play, even when it's cold) and adults are children of fire (they will get cold, so they stay near fire)".</p>

<a href="#33">[3]</a> Can he be blamed? Souma broke a table with his sword the day he met Shinobu. Read more <a href="../../Idol-Stories/samurai-and-ninjas.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
<p id="4">
<a href="#44">[4]</a> It's uncertain which job Shinobu is referring to here, as RYUSEITAI had done various big jobs across the summer prior to this event.</p>
<p id="5">
<a href="#55">[5]</a> Both Shinobu and Tetora refer to Chiaki as 隊長 (taichou), or captain.</p>
<p id="6">
<a href="#66">[6]</a> He's using 殿 (dono) by itself here.</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> Japan has very strict regulations on the possession and use of firearms and swords, via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_and_Sword_Possession_Control_Law" target="_blank">Swords and Firearms Possession Control Law</a>.</p></div>
