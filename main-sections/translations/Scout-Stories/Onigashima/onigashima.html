<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>But… that's right. At times like this, it's a matter of reversing logic.

<div class="quotelabel">

<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>Under what scenario…? Ah! Now that you mention it! <i>That's</i> what Taishou said! “If things keep goin’ this way, the people I cherish are gonna get hurt.”

</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Well, then that's the reason. If that's the case, it makes sense that Kiryu would try to make a move. I suppose this is him trying to protect us or someone else at the academy.

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>To start with, since it seems like Taishou’s friends might get affected too, the enemy has to have a real deep grudge against him, right?

<div class="quotelabel">

</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Well, given the situation and how Kiryu was acting, it certainly seems like they have a strong grudge against him.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>Taishou is strong, after all. But they’ve gotta be someone holding a constant resentment for Taishou, right? Is there anyone like that around?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>A grudge… Kiryu is a reputable person, though, so I don't think there's anyone who would hold a grudge against him.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>A lot happened in this academy in the old days, but most of the people from that time have already left this school.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Now, of the remaining students, there are probably more people who are grateful to Kiryu than not.

<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Hmph. At the time, I was extremely busy participating in another event, and the academy was empty too. I simply just didn't realize it was going on at the time.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Had I known in advance, I would have definitely put a stop to it.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">

</div>
<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>Mhm. There was suddenly a job to do at the time.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>But, hmmm... If that's the case, could it perhaps be an old familiar face? Someone he knew before entering this academy……
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Hmm... I’m not saying it isn’t possible, but I've never seen him with someone like that.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>I don’t think so either. I see Taishou all the time, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him meet up with anyone like that before.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>As I figured. I have no recollection of Kiryu-dono ever being with such a person as well.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>No. If we keep speculating like this, we will never reach the truth! Why don’t we ask Kiryu-dono about all of this directly?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Denied. If we do that and make Kiryu suspicious of us, it’s likely he’ll just lie to cover up the truth.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>And if Kiryu sneaks around about it, it’ll be even harder to pin down the other party.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>Which means... Maybe watching over Taishou would be the best way of goin’ about it? Keepin’ an eye on him if he acts weird and stopping him if it seems like he’s gonna head to the other person?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">

<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>So I was secretly practicin’ the lines for my sword fightin’ scene, and Tetsu misunderstood me ‘cuz of it.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>You’re beyond saving! If you had just talked to us about this, none of this would have ever happened.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Good grief... I understand the gist of the situation, but why is Anzu here too?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Ahh. That it? Tetsu wasn’t the only one to see me practice my lines; lil’ miss saw me too. When I told her all about it, she offered to help me out. Right, miss?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Ah, I have no intention of blaming you, so don't apologize, Anzu.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>This situation came from a comedy of errors. I don't think it's anyone's fault.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">

<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>So, today was the day of the event, and what we were tailing was Kiryu-dono buying souvenirs for the children along the way.

<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>Ahh… But I'm glad I was wrong~…
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="tetora"><p>Ah! It’s not like I didn’t believe in you, Taishou! But, given the situation, I started to worry more and more.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>To be fair, if someone was going to be harmed, you would be more than likely to take action.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>In the first place, you always carry everything by yourself, and that’s how this misunderstanding happened. Reflect on that.
</p></div>

<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Haha, you’re not wrong. Sorry for worryin’ you guys so much — Hasumi-no-danna, Tetsu, Kanzaki.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>Honestly, I’m just relieved that nothing happened.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="souma"><p>Oh? It seems like the kindergarten teachers are calling Kiryu-dono for something?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Hm? You’re right. Is somethin’ the matter?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Ah, nah, these guys aren't members of the event. They’re more like my visitors…
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Ah, that's right. It doesn’t change the fact I’m doin’ the whole play myself. I'm plannin’ on having lil’ miss work on behind the scenes stuff.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>Hm? Are there not enough people to do the play?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>It’s just barely enough. I'm Momotaro, and the rest of the roles are gonna be handled by the teachers.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>But they gotta look after the kids too, so they don’t feel like they’ve got enough people around unless they do both jobs.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Well, it might be a complete frenzy behind the scenes, but it'll work out somehow.
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="keito"><p>You’re the cause for this whole mess in the first place, and yet you’re back to acting distant with us and carrying the burden by yourself again!

  <b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Lil’ miss, are ya done cleanin’ yet? Ah, you did? When I was straightenin’ up all the backstage scene stuff you got left with basically everything… Sorry ‘bout that.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>The play was a huge success, huh? I didn't think the kids would love it that much.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Didja have fun too, lil’ miss? Yeah, that’s good. Danna ‘n the other two seemed happy to be surrounded by the kids too.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Mm? Ah, yeah you’re right. With how messy this turned out in the end, I shoulda done like you said and asked everyone for advice after all.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>There’s not much reward to doing this, and while it wouldn’t be so bad if it were Nito’s Ra*bits, but AKATSUKI’s so far from this kinda audience, it felt hard to bring up.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>But as ya said, those guys didn’t care about that kinda thing at all.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>I could act like I knew what I was doin’, and relax, while those guys helped me out and supported me.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Haha. For sure. Maybe the kids loved the play so much ‘cuz the atmosphere was so relaxed from the get go.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>The teachers really liked it too, so I finally felt good about it all.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>I’m real grateful they liked it, but I got real nervous when they said they wanted me to come back next month ‘n do it again.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Eh? Oi, oi. Gimme a break, lil’ miss. Even though things turned out this way, I still had no clue what the hell I was doin’, y’know? Though, of course I wasn’t plannin’ on just throwin’ in the towel midway.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>I was worried the kids would be disappointed if I was the one bein’ Momotaro. But, well, it seems they were pleased with it, so that was a relief.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>“Don’t say that”...? Haha, Lil’ miss scolded me.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Nah, I didn’t mean to make fun of you, I was just thinkin’ you said it in a way that’s similar to when my lil’ sister gets mad at me for somethin’.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>By the way, what happened to the other guys?
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Ahh, it’s afternoon nap time for all the kids? They’re helpin’ out with that, then.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Mm? Lil miss is gonna go ‘n help the teachers? I’ll help out too, then. I was under your care today, so lemme do this much for ya.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Danna and the others are probably havin’ a harder time than you are…? Well, I guess so. There are a lot more people where they are.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>Gotcha. I'll help Hasumi-no-danna’s group. I'm sure it was the classroom next door, right?

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>

<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>We didn’t have enough hands, so it couldn’t be helped. Besides, for that role, your job was to do ventriloquism while holdin’ the pheasant doll.
</p></div> 
<div class="quote" id="kuro"><p>And you did a pretty fine job at that, Danna. Didn’t all the kids hound you for an encore afterwards?

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KURO</b>

<div class="quotelabel">
  <b>KEITO</b>

<p id="3">
  <a href="#33">[3]</a> -殿 (-dono) is an honorific that roughly means "lord" or "master". It's archaic, which gives Souma an old-timey feel.</p>
<p id="4">
  <a href="#44">[4]</a> AKATSUKI's Chocolat Fes story is <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Decorate" target="_blank">Decorate</a>.

<p id="5">
<a href="#55">[5]</a> Onigashima hinges around the phrase『お礼参り』する (lit. pay one's respects at a shrine). Colliqually, this refers to someone who's going to retaliate against someone else (i.e., someone who hasn't paid a loan). Souma thinks Tetora is using its original meaning.</p>
<p id="6"></p>
<a href="#66">[6]</a> In Japanese, words from other languages (such as English) are typically rendered in katakana. However, when Souma uses katakana words, they are all written in hiragana instead, likely to emphasize how he struggles with foreign words. These words are kept as written in hiragana, and put in "quotes".</p>
<p id="7">
<a href="#77">[7]</a> From the story <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Four_Beasts_of_Fistfighting" target="_blank">Four Beasts of Fist Fighting</a>. Keito's playing coy here because he was actually the one to divert attention away from the Dragon King Competition.</p>
<p id="8">
  <a href="#88">[8]</a> Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, lit. master ), or "boss". He'll also use Hasumi-no-danna.</p>
<p id="9">
<a href="#99">[9]</a> Statues of <a href="https://www.stillsitting.com/who-is-jizo/" target="_blank">the Bodhisattva Jizo</a> often dot along trails and sit innocuously, looking over wandering travelers.</p>
<p id="10">
  <a href="#100">[10]</a> Tetora is saying 止めて stay with me (stop, don't go) but Kuro thinks he's saying 泊めて stay (at my place) because they're both pronounced とまる.</p>
<p id="32">
  <a href="#322">[11]</a> Based on folklore, giving someone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_thousand_origami_cranes">one thousand origami cranes</a> is meant to wish them well or wish them long health. </p>
<p id="12">
<a href="#112">[12]</a> This happened in <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wolf_and_Red_Riding_Hood" target="_blank">The Wolf and Red Riding Hood</a> with Kuro, Souma, Nazuna and Shinobu.</p>
