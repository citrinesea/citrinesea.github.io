<div class="keitoquote"><p>Ukiyo-e, now highly regarded around the world, was originally considered to have as much artistic value as tissue paper.

<div class="keitoquote"><p>In a former age, TV, games, and even idols were ridiculed and looked down upon as tacky.

<div class="keitoquote"><p>Now, in our modern day, even the things that are looked down upon as vulgar or commonplace... With time and effort, they become art.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>For future generations, it may even be appreciated as part of traditional culture.

<div class="keitoquote"><p>Ninjas… Aren’t they splendid? Since it has an air of Japanese style, we can incorporate it within the context of AKATSUKI.

<div class="keitoquote"><p>Of course, it won’t be easy… but if done well, I think it would be a mutually beneficial proposal.

<div class="keitoquote"><p>I’ll formalize some official paperwork, approve it as a DreamFes, and formulate a budget.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Well, design-wise, we should keep to the theme as best we can.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>The performance doesn’t need to be a musical-esque narrative either.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Regardless, I'm sure fans of the movie will come to see it, so I'd like to take the initiative to incorporate its trademark lines.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>The DreamFes venue is a tourist spot that recreates the world of period dramas. It gets used for movie shootings, too.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Additionally, the sponsor will be the event organizers at the site.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>The organizers have the personnel and know-how to manage stage production, so we can just give our input and leave it to them. Hasumi and I will handle the negotiations.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Admission will be free. It seems that the profit will come from limited-edition merchandise.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Ah, Takamine, sorry. Your captain is talking right now, so please be quiet.
</p></div>

</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>Ehh...? Even though you never listen whenever I tell you to shut up...?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Ahaha... Anyway, most guests at tourist destinations aren’t usually interested in idols.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Of course, our fans will come to see us, but for the most part, the audience will be the general public.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>There will be a lot of older people who don't know about the unspoken etiquette of idol concerts, so...
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>We’ll have to be careful about how we present ourselves. Be mindful of your words and actions and be considerate. Give thorough explanations.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>If things go well, we'll be able to attract new fans out of the people who don't normally have anything to do with us. Good luck, everyone. Hip, hip, hooray! ♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hip, hip, hooray! ♪ I'll check with Hasumi-dono, but I don't think there's any problem with AKATSUKI going in that direction.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Now that the outline has been decided, I would like to work out the specific content of the “raibu”.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Sounds good. Sengoku is the one who knows a lot about ninjas, so I'll leave it to him from here on out.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Ah~... I'm a little worn out after such a lively discussion. I'm parched.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I've made some tea, so please help yourself. There are also teacakes I’ve made by hand.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>Souma, you’re getting “better” at “cooking” more and more, aren’t you…~?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Cooking aside, I’ve practiced conducting tea ceremonies since I was a child. It's a samurai tradition...
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Though, I don’t feel that it matches the Western-style atmosphere of “Gaaden Terasu”.

</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Anyway, everyone, help yourselves to some refreshments.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Wow! Thank you so much~ I used my brain a lot today, so it’s craving sugar~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I am the same way. I should try to think for myself without leaving things to my seniors more often… However, they say that it's difficult to tell a poor thinker from a sleeping one.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>Ahaha. As a “senpai”, I’d like you to try “thinking” for yourself a little more.
</p></div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>“Leaving everything up to us” entirely is a lot of “responsibility”, which is “frightening”.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Yeah. I think so too.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>However, Kanzaki-kun is a second year student. He has solid opinions, a lot of experience, and he’s reliable. His input was pretty helpful.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Thanks to him, Scroll of the Elements is coming together surprisingly smoothly.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Haha, I feel somewhat bashful. Kiryu-dono is delayed in joining us, and Hasumi-dono can't take his hands off student council duties, so...</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>As the representative of AKATSUKI, I shouldn’t do anything embarrassing.</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>How admirable, Souma. Good boy, good boy…♪</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm? Buchou-dono is extremely kind today…! But he always treats me rather harshly, so it's actually kind of scary…?</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>No, I understand that the usual is a matter of tough love, however!</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>Ufufu. If you always acted “seriously”, I wouldn’t be so “unkind” to you, either…~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Uuu... I always try to be serious, though…</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>That’s not fair~! Shinkai-dono, you’re (being) really nice to your club’s underclassman, huh~?</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>I'm always “kind”~. “Clubs” and “units" are different.
</p></div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>If I had the same “attitude” for both, it’d be “weird”, wouldn’t it?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>Nghhh, I want Taishou to pat my head and call me a good kid, too. Um, Kanzaki-senpai, Taishou seems to be busy… I wonder where he is right now; what’s he been doing…?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Haven't you heard? Lately, Kiryu-dono’s been participating in a multitude of “B1”' tournaments out of the blue.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>You see, one of his classmates has asked him to appear to help.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Though this is our period of rest, he said that if he has nothing to do, he will inevitably get out of shape…</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>After all, he is truly a gallant warrior at heart.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Additionally, we, AKATSUKI, have always ruled as statesmen, and have only ever competed against weak opponents.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Therefore, it’s likely he wanted to dress up as a footsoldier and crawl through the mud to gauge the atmosphere of the front lines.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Otherwise, our perceptions will gradually deviate from reality.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>If you settle for turning away from battle and hiding in basecamp, you will lose your survival instinct and miscalculate the real state of affairs.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>That sort of thing is what he seems to think, anyway. I agree with Kiryu-dono, and I’m proud of him. The two of us are lucky to have a great senior♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>Umyu… If that's the case, I wish he’d invited me too. Is it unmanly to think that way?
</p></div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>But Taishou’s way of life really is cool after all~♪
</p></div>
<div class="tetoraquote"><p>It’s been a while since Taishou’s gone around operating solo... Ahh, I’d love to see his valiant figure. Can I go watch his match for a li’l while?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>After we finish having this discussion. You and Sengoku are both first years, so support <i>him</i>.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>For having peers you can walk alongside with is something to be very thankful for.
