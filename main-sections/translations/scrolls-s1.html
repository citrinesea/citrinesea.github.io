</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Now, in our modern day, even the things that are looked down upon as vulgar or commonplace... With time and effort, they become art.
</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>For future generations, it may even be appreciated as part of traditional culture.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Due to copyright issues, we can’t really use movie lines verbatim, but...

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Well, design-wise, we should keep to the theme as best we can.

<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Regardless, I'm sure fans of the movie will come to see it, so I'd like to take the initiative to incorporate its trademark lines.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>The DreamFes venue is a tourist spot that recreates the world of period dramas. It gets used for movie shootings, too.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Additionally, the sponsor will be the event organizers at the site.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>The organizers have the personnel and know-how to manage stage production, so we can just give our input and leave it to them. Hasumi and I will handle the negotiations.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>The purpose of the live show is to attract tourists to the venue and promote newly opened attractions and facilities.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>Admission will be free. It seems that the profit will come from limited-edition merchandise.
</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>I’ll leave the preparation of goods and the like to Anzu. It’s her specialty, and she seems to have connections.
