<div class="locationquote"><b>★ in the hallway</b></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>O~i, Kanzaki-dono! Kanzaki-dono~ ☆</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm? Oh, Sengoku. You're full of energy as always. However, though it’s said that children will run even on a windy day, you shouldn’t run in the hallway.</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Hm? I'm not a child, am I? I’m already a high school student~
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Fufu, in the eyes of the world, high school students are still considered children. And whether you are an adult or a child, you must refrain from actions that cause trouble to others.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hasumi-dono always scolds me for that, too.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Look. The papers I was carrying were swept away by the wind, thanks to you rushing in.</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, pardon me! Here, I'll pick them up~♪</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm. I’m grateful… That aside, did you need something from me?
</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Huh? Ah, no, I didn’t have anything in particular! It’s just that when I saw you, Kanzaki-dono, I got so happy that I ran up to you~</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>What, are you a puppy? However, I'm happy that you’ve become attached to me, as I don’t have much of a relationship with the underclassmen.</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Kanzaki-dono, it’s hard to approach you because you always walk around with a sword hanging at your side. You’re also a member of AKATSUKI, the student council’s headlining unit…</p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>It’s absolutely because of things like that that everyone perceives you as an intimidating person.</p></div>  

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you also scared of me, Sengoku…?</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Not at all! I used to think you were a menacing person, but when I talked to you, I realized you were really kind!</p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, but is it going to be too annoying if I get too friendly?!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>That won’t happen. Let’s continue to get along… Sengoku ♪
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>At any rate, Sengoku, are you free right now? Hasumi-dono asked me to put up these “posutaa” on the bulletin board.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>However, I’m having a difficult time with the amount. I’d appreciate your help.</p></div>  

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>That’s an easy task~! RYUSEITAI has just finished a big job and is currently on a break, so I have plenty of free time!</p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Surprisingly, our unit’s <b>Taichou-dono</b> gives us plenty of good rest~♪</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It is the same for me. We are both blessed with good masters, aren’t we?</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>AKATSUKI is also on break.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>The “Harouin Paatii” S1 will be held soon, you see. Hasumi-dono, or rather the student council, has been extremely busy preparing for it.</p></div> 
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It's not to the point where he’s immobile, but it would be troubling if he were to push himself and deteriorate his health.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Therefore, I'm helping out with student council errands in hopes of getting Hasumi-dono the freedom to move a little.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>The current bustling of the student council is Hasumi-dono’s own personal matters, so…</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Kiryu-dono and I have been told that we can take on individual work in the meantime, or unit work as only the two of us.</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>However, I feel that in doing so, we’d march on ahead without him. It makes me feel shameful. Could it be because I lack independence?</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, I also have a lot of free time when RYUSEITAI isn’t active. We’re similar after all~♪</p></div> 

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Is that right? Well, ninjas and warriors might be similar in the eyes of the public, I suppose, but....
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>…Hm? Forgive me, Anzu-dono. I was about to kick you. Why are you kneeling here?</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you feeling unwell? Are you okay? Should I take you to the infirmary?</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>You don't look like you've slept much, Producer-dono. I'm worried that you might be overworked!</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>If you give us your order, we who serve our “lord” will take care of all your troubles☆</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Hya!? Eh!? “Don't refer to me as "lord" too much”...? I’d have understood it if you just said it~ I don't like you pinching my cheeks!</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Now, now, Anzu-dono. Don't bully Sengoku too much, Buddha is watching.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hm. Anzu-dono has been asked to do various projects, but has hit a wall...
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>You came to see the “posutaa'' on the bulletin board in case they had anything useful to reference?
</p></div> 
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Certainly, there are often “B1” notices, announcements and recruitment listings posted on this particular bulletin board.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>There are so many that it would be futile to try peeling them all off, and they would just be put back up again. Even Hasumi-dono is overlooking it at this point.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Actually, the other day, we AKATSUKI participated in the “B1” Quarrel Festival...
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>We’re not in a position where we can openly regulate “B1”s anymore.
</p></div>  
<div class="soumaquote"><p>If we were to criticize someone for participating, and they were to criticize us for having done the same, we wouldn’t be able to refute it.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>But a lively atmosphere is a good thing, so I suppose it's a mixed blessing.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>…Huh? What's wrong, Anzu-dono? Do I have something on my face?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm, “Are you interested in historical dramas”...? Does it seem like I am?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>It does, Kanzaki-dono. Moreso, you come off as the kind of embarrassing guy who likes historical dramas and samurai so much that he wears a sword just for the sake of it.</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Is that right…? Then let me explain just in case, but I have government authorization to wear a sword! Look, look, my license~♪
</p></div>  

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>The government? Who exactly are you, Kanzaki-dono…?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Anyway, what were you saying about historical dramas, Producer-dono?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I like them and watch them often~!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>In historical dramas, ninjas are usually minor roles or one-off fighters, so I end up a little dissatisfied with their portrayal.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Eh? If there was a historical drama that featured ninjas in the spotlight, would I want to appear in it?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I-Is there a proposal out there that looks like it was prepared just for me!?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>If that's the case, I definitely want to appear! I won't let anyone else have it because it's my <i>dream!</i>
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Fwoohh, my time has come at last~! ☆
