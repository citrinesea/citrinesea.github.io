<b>Keito's Answer</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>AKATSUKI is a unit that focuses on traditional performing arts. After all, there is no one who can surpass us in terms of brilliance.</p></div> 
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Many other "units" operate in a friendly manner, but unlike them, we are particular about our unique performance as an expression of our daily training and traditional culture. I think that commitment is our charm point.

<b>Kuro's Answer</b>

<div class="kuroquote"><p>Akatsuki is a unit with a bond stronger than blood. In other words, that's how I'd define <i>us</i>.</p></div> 
<div class="kuroquote"><p>Both Kanzaki and I love to perform Akatsuki's live performances with all of us together. At first glance, we might not seem like close friends, but deep down we are connected. I think that's the most appealing thing about Akatsuki.</p></div>
<div class="kuroquote">
<p>Personally, by belonging to Akatsuki, it's made me wanna work as an idol seriously. Right now, I can't imagine being anywhere else.</p></div>

<b>Souma's Answer</b>

<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hasumi-dono, the leader of “Akatsuki”, is an honorable personage. Both Kiryu-dono and I rush to exert our best because of Hasumi-dono. Therefore, it can be said that the most attractive part of Akatsuki is Hasumi-dono.</p></div> 
<div class="soumaquote"><p>A samurai has meaning only if he serves his master. But in truth, it is far more common for a samurai not to be blessed with a master. . . In that respect, I am truly blessed with a good master ♪

<b>Isara Mao's Answer (from Trickstar)</b>

<div class="maoquote"><p>For a while, I had the experience of working with AKATSUKI, and not to mention, I’m also a member of the student council. I think I know more about AKATSUKI than the others.</p></div> 
<div class="maoquote"><p>AKATSUKI is a unit established by the vice president, and its members feel suitable for the unit. Since it incorporates traditional arts and culture, there are some aspects that are a little rigid, but it’s a good unit where you can feel a strong, deep sense of trust and unity ♪</p></div>

</p></div>
<div class="yuzuruquote"><p>Mm… My impression of AKATSUKI… I have the impression that Kiryu-sama and Kanzaki-sama support the vice president, and the vice president supervises as a whole, making it a very well-balanced unit.</p></div></div>

<div class="toriquote"><p>AKATSUKI…~? <i>fine</i> is number one, and AKATSUKI is number two. I don't think it's necessary to say such an obvious thing now, but I’ll mention it just in case.<p></div> 
<div class="toriquote"><p>
Well, since he's a childhood friend of the chairman, he's quite capable, and I guess it’s a unit with a sense of leadership that's different from <i>fine</i>.

<div class="adonisquote"><p>
He seems to respect Hasumi-senpai, as well as Kiryu-senpai. I think that AKATSUKI has built good interpersonal relationships with each other.

<div class="tsukasaquote"><p>
Hmm, I belong to the same club as Hasumi-senpai, the leader of Akatsuki. It seems that Big Sis is learning how to make costumes from Kiryu-senpai. I have no contact with Kanzaki-senpai, so I can't say anything about him…</p></div> 
<div class="tsukasaquote"><p>
Since it has the strict Hasumi-senpai, I think it is a well-disciplined unit.

Hm? You weren't asking about fine, you'd rather hear about AKATSUKI? Hmph, I told you. I'm not interested in the masses. It doesn't matter whether my friend Kiryu is in AKATSUKI or not: they are part of the same flock.
