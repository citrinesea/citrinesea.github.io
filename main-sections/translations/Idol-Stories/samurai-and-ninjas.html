<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hello, Transfer student-dono. We’ve been seeing a lot of each other at “Gaaden Terasu” as of late, huh? Are you also having lunch?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Mm, food and health are inextricably linked.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I want you to eat a lot, get healthy, and produce us idols relentlessly…♪ 
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>As usual, I’m putting on the act as a chef. If you’d like, let me serve you some homemade food.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Also, I had so much fun chopping up the ingredients that I ended up preparing a lot of them...♪
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hm, that's what you intended? Because you want to save food costs? Hm, then there’s no need for my concern. Transfer student-dono is such a strong woman!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Splendid, bravo~♪ If you're happy with my cooking, I’d like you to eat it to your heart's content. May it become a source of energy for you!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Do you mind if I join you? It’s more pleasant to eat with a group~♪ Mm. Excuse me…
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hold on a moment. This is too much for one person to eat, but not enough for two people. Let’s finish cooking a little bit more.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Do you have any “reku-ests”? I’m getting tired of always eating seafood. I have some premium meat that Adonis-dono gave me, so maybe I’ll have that for t—…
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Huh? — A scoundrel!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Eyaaa?! Wh-Wh– Why did a table get cut to pieces in front of me?! 
</p></div>

            alt="Samurai and Ninjas"></div></div>  

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I-I– I'm definitely not a suspicious person! If you could just spare me my life…?!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hm, who are you? What do you intend to do by sneaking around on the floor, you dodgy fellow?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you a thief? You lawless cad! For the sake of "Gaaden Terasu", this Kanzaki Souma will inflict punishment upon you!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>W-Wait a second! Why is this person wielding a Japanese sword as if it’s normal? This is a violation of the Firearms and Swords Act!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm, you are... I believe you are Sengoku from the Ninja Association. You. Are you acting suspicious again?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Good grief, it’s a complete nuisance. For some reason, people seem to think you’re close friends with me.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Huh, why? I'm the type of ninja who doesn't have many close friends, though…
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>But it’s not that I can't make friends because I’m shy! Ninjas are like shadows, destined to live by erasing all traces of their very presence...!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm. I’m samurai-like. You’re ninja-like. The public seems to think that samurai and ninja are birds of a feather.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ehh!? Ninjas and samurai are completely different! But there were <i>some</i> ninjas who became feudal lords, so I guess it depends on the character of the region?
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>And um, Kanzaki-dono is more of a “swordsman” than a “samurai”, right?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Well, I'm not interested in the distinction. However, the problem is that you and I are considered to be compatriots.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Whenever you do something strange, I get frowned upon, too. It’s better to live a more  straightforward life, more pure and honest.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>If you live right, instead of crawling around on the floor like that, you'll be able to face the sun with pride.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>F-For some reason, I'm being scolded... Uu~? But I can’t relax in bright places, y’know~…?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>… What on earth have you been doing since a while ago? You can eat while sitting on a chair. Ninjas seem like they’re completely unfamiliar with etiquette.
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>If you're hungry, I'll share some of my food with you.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Yaaay, I've graduated from eating by myself~!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ah, Transfer student-dono was here too! I wonder if I've interrupted your date...?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>We’re simply “kurasumeito”. We just so happened to share a table today. Now that’s enough, it's time to eat. It's said that nausea dwells in an empty stomach.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Thank you, thank you...! I was running out of food allowance this month. Honestly, I was in trouble.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Also, here in Garden Terrace... I was doing a little fly-catching.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Well, now that I see it closely, it’s flypaper! You— Don't show those things while we’re eating! It’s unsanitary, I'll lose my appetite!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Are you going to eat it? Do you eat flies? As I thought, I can't understand ninjas...!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Hey, please don't draw your sword?! I’m not going to eat them~! These flies are meant to be frog food.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Fr-Frogs? Are you raising them as pets?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>They’re more like friends than pets to raise~. Ninjas use dogs, birds, frogs, and the like.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>But dogs bite, and birds nip with their beaks, so frogs are the best ones to get along with.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>However, they're bigger eaters than they look. The cost of food is ridiculous, so that’s why I catch flies myself, if that makes sense...?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>I-I see. That’s why you set foot for “Gaaden Terasu”. Certainly, those types of insects tend to gather in the dining hall.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>That’s right~ Oops, found another fly! I'll capture it~☆
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Don't mess around while you’re eating! Have you no manners!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Forgive me a million times over, but I'm seriously in trouble. I can't let my frogs go hungry...
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I'm starving because I'm cutting back on my own food expenses. Ninjas and samurai alike cannot fight if they are hungry.
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>So please give me your patience— hm hm! There are flies again~☆
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hey, that's annoying! Besides, flies have compound eyes. They have excellent dynamic vision, so you can't catch them with movements like that! Watch!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>En garde–!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ooh, you caught a fly with chopsticks! That’s amazing...☆
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hehe. I don't try to pretend I’m as skilled as the ancient swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, but...  for a well-trained martial artist, a target such as this is a breeze before breakfast. Ha! Take that! And that!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Wow, that’s amazing! I want you to catch more, and I want you to teach me how to do it, too~♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Heh, I don't hate being praised. But my training will be severe, you know.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Bring it on! Enduring all hardships is what makes a ninja—...
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ow?!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Ogh?! Wh-Why are you hitting us, Transfer student-dono!
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Huh, “Don't fool around while eating”...? That's right, this ninja managed to get me carried away!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Is it my fault?!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>But well, I certainly don't think it would be a good idea to play with flies while we eat! Forgive me, Transfer student-dono!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hehe. Sengoku, you also call Transfer student-dono "Transfer student-dono", huh?
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>It gives off the impression that we are samurai and ninja who serve the same master, so what say you and I get along better from now on?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I'm so happy! Yaaay, I've made a new friend... ♪ Transfer student-dono brought us together!
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>I’m so thankful, I should call you “Lord" instead of “Transfer student-dono”! You are our master, Lord!
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Lord, why have you stopped eating? Come come, eat as much as you like～♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Lord～♪
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Lord～☆
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>.. Ow?! You hit me again! I suppose you’d rather be called “Princess” instead of “Lord”?
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Hmm, a girl's heart is complicated...
</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Sengoku, if you're having trouble finding food for your frogs, come to the Marine Life Club room later. We may have some food stocked up, so I'll lend you a little.
</p></div>

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Uwaa, that'd save me trouble! But it's cool to catch flies with chopsticks too. I'd be happy if you could teach me how to do it later~♪
</p></div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>Ehehe, I had a really fun lunchtime today! I am terribly grateful~♪
