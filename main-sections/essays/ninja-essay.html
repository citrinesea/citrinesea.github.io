<p><b>Starting the Ninja Association</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>In his first weeks at Yumenosaki, Shinobu aims to start the Ninja Association. After Shinobu meets Chiaki and joins RYUSEITAI, Chiaki encourages him to take the steps to make it happen.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">

<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<p>I have summoned a lot of courage! Hehehe. This is also thanks to Taichou-dono! When I wasn't sure whether I should start the Ninja Association or not, he encouraged me, saying "if you want to do it, then go do it!"</p>
<p>If he hadn't lectured me like that, I would probably be dying in fear right now!</p>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>!-Era | ❀ Spring | Sparkly First Years (meatball124)</p></div></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>During Tanabata Festival, Shinobu recounts the first time he met Mao that day. Amidst other students wanting to form clubs, Shinobu was lost in the crowd. Mao noticed him, called out to him, and after hearing out what he wanted to do, explained how they could make it possible.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">
<div class="outsidequote">
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<p>[...] But what really made me happy was you treating me normally. I started babbling about something so silly, telling you about how I wish to make a club for people who love ninjas, and that we will do ninja training in it...</p>
<p>Then you explained all sorts of things, like how a club without enough members turns into an association.</p>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>This is why it's the Ninja Association, and not Ninja Club</p></div>

<div class="labelcategory">
<p><b>Promotional Activities</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>In Scroll of the Elements, Shinobu brings up a potential gig for a joint live performance between Akatsuki and Ryuseitai. Chiaki leads the charge in convincing Keito to take it on and make it into a proposal. Keito does so and praises Shinobu for running the Ninja Association on his own.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">
<div class="outsidequote">
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<p>I heard that you're hosting a Ninja Association of some kind. You are the lord of one country and one castle. Since you manage it without the help of anyone else, be more resolute.</p>
<p>Isara’s been worried, so even though club activities are just a hobby, you should give it all your might.</p>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>!-Era | ❦ Autumn | Scroll of the Elements (citrinesea)</p></div></div></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Additionally, Keito asks Shinobu to work on Scroll of the Elements as promotional material for the Ninja Association. By associating the joint-live with the Ninja Association, Shinobu can create a track record of notable club activities to attract members in the future.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">
<div class="outsidequote">
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<p>Mm, keep at it. The same goes for this project — If we say it was done with the full cooperation of the Ninja Association, it will be a part of its records. Since I’ll be drafting documents along those lines already, I would like you to prepare necessary materials.</p>

<p>We’re already halfway into this school term, so I suppose you can’t expect any new members, but... You're a first-year student. If you create a track record now, you’ll have that next year and circumstances will change..</p>

<p><b>Chiaki and Keito's Support</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>After the events of Scrolls, Keito grows interested in Shinobu as (a) a member of Broadcasting Committee (centralized information) and (b) a member of the Student Council. To keep tabs on Mao, Keito employs him as a secret emissary.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">
<div class="outsidequote">
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<p>At first, I asked Sengoku if he could do it, considering I’ve been getting him to keep me regularly updated on how the Student Council is doing, as I tend to worry about Isara as the president.</p>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>!!-Era | ❆ Winter | Submarine (310mc)</p></div></div></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>In Submarine, Keito asks Shinobu to fulfill the same duty. However, Shinobu refers him to Chiaki instead: Chiaki's secret order makes it easier to be discreet.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">
<div class="outsidequote">
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<p>Alright, so… We began sharing information with Akatsuki after forming a common front. At first, I was the one who was asked to be the mediator, but this time around, Morisawa-dono was much more convenient for the role, so I requested that he do it in my stead.</p>
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<p>Yup! I was Ninja-man, who went around Okinawa gathering information and passing it on to the right people!</p>

<p>Ninja-man! That’s so cool~</p>

<p>Sengoku seems to be happy to have a chance to act like a ninja, too! Thanks for playing with my junior, Hasumi.</p>
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<p>I’m not playing with him… Though I do think I should reward Sengoku sooner or later for acting as my subordinate.</p>
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<p>I recall him saying he’s simply returning the favor you did for him in Scroll of the Elements, so don’t worry about it.</p>
<div class="citationtext">

<div class="note"><b>contributor's note</b>: post-Submarine, I like to imagine Chiaki trails after them like "how are you doing, fellow ninja? (:" (desperately buzzing and seeking connection with the two of them)
<br></br></div></div></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>And Shinobu’s not the only one looking for friends.</p></div>

<div class="fade-in-right-on-scroll">

</div>
<p>Ahh, dammit…! You just had to mention you were bored…!</p>
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>MADARA</b>
</div>
<p>Ho ho. Chiaki-san, you said that? You couldn’t get yourself to mention it before. What made you change your mind?</p>
<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<p>Ah, no. I just happened to see them yesterday, that’s all. I ended up mentioning how bored I was, and Sengoku invited me to hang out.</p>
<p>He also had free time for similar reasons as mine, so he was more than happy to spend time together. Hehe, looks like I was holding back more than necessary.</p>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>It’s really cute that they both indulge him, and I find it special Shinobu has senpai who look after him and empower his interests.</p></div>

<div class="outsidequotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b></div>
<p>I've trained so much, but a lot of the jutsus still ended in failure... It's kind of depressing, but at least the Jutsu of Summoning I tried in the past was a success... "May I make friends", I said.</p>
