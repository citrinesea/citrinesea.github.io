<div class="essay-analysis"><p>The short answer to your question: Yes, I have—on Tumblr, I posted a mini, shambled-together version of a “hear me out” on them as a pairing. At first, I was just going to copy-paste that, but reading it now, it just doesn’t go into the depth it needs to make Kanakei make sense.</p>

<p>As for the long answer, see below.</p>

<p>It’s going to start out heavy, lore-wise, and then there’ll be lighter parts to it. I’ve labeled my different sections clearly, so if you want to skip certain parts, you can find what you like.</p>

<div class="citationtext">
<p> Pre-War Era | ☀︎ Summer | Meteor Impact (310mc)</p></div></div>


<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Keito's self-esteem issues are abysmal. Even in !!-era, with Rei’s tests and insistences (see Succession Match) for Keito to see him as equals, he just doesn’t clear that hurdle. Very intense character development and self-esteem needs to be built for Keito to reciprocate what Rei wants him to.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>On the other hand, Kanata is notable, because he is an attainable adversary. The entire point of Meteor Impact is that Keito is taking down a God himself-- it’s one more shot to redeem himself from the failure of DEADMANZ Live.</p></div>

<h6><b>Eichi and Wataru</b></h6></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Here, Keito is the grounder (Eichi) and Kanata is the grounded (Wataru). It's not completely identical, though. There’s a third element: Chiaki is the ground itself. When at Yumenosaki, Kanata feels the alienation from his pedestal intensify as he spends time walking among peers.</div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Despite Keito’s more direct hand in Kanata’s subjugation, Kanata holds an unusual distinction between Eichi and Keito by his third year.</p></div>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>I refuse to forgive him [Eichi], though~ because he made my ‘Friends’ suffer. It is not about what happened to me—the real problem is that he got ‘Involved’ with my ‘Friends’.</p></div>
<div class="kanataquote"><p>"on the other hand, the temple guy is surprisingly not that ‘Revolting’— i will not listen to what he ‘Says’ ever again, though… by that, I mean his ‘Wishes’. It is all his fault that I could not stay as a god, after all. As frustrating as it is, I suppose I could also say it is thanks to him.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>And to him, the change is for the better. Chiaki was the one to teach Kanata what humanity really is—what it means to have dreams, not wishes, for oneself. When Keito is the one to throw Kanata from the sky, Chiaki is the one that catches him.</p></div>

<div class="kanataquote"><p>‘Humans’ are so ‘Refined’ aren’t they? fufu, i say that despite being a ‘human’ too… no. i used to be a ‘God’ not too ‘Long Ago’. but now i’m a human. if i were still living in the sea today, i would probably still be granting people’s wishes without ever questioning it, forever at the bottom of the sea, until the day i die.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Kanata and Keito casually come back from an impressive amount of depressing events in Meteor Impact. Based on their history, the subjugation is only just a microcosm of Shinkai-Hasumi turf disputes.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Keito’s motives don’t have much to do with furthering his own family’s religion, as it is squashing the growing cult presence in Yumenosaki. His concern is Kanata’s influence and the Yaobikuni suffocating the school, an area he wants to cultivate influence from for the student council.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Keito and Kanata’s main issue is communication—and it’s mostly on Keito. They’re both stubborn, but Kanata does try. As Keito expresses in Comic World, he never intends to resort to wartime brutality again as long as he has his power.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Keito lives with his mind in the past: he wants to prove he's adapted to prevent what he’s done from ever happening again. Kanata aims for the future: he doesn't like hearing about the War and wants to move on.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Ideally (during RST Kanata Climax, perhaps), when it comes time to dismantle the aspects he doesn’t like about the cult, he calls upon the professional Shinkai-cult killer (alongside Madara). After a quick negotiation where Kanata allows his family’s temple autonomy, Keito helps Kanata, and when Kanata tells him it’s time to stop, he obliges. He’s atoned for the War by helping usher in a Kanata's new ideal.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Meteor Impact was about Kanata granting Keito’s wish and giving him control. Scrolls was about Kanata denying Keito the right to wish and control him. Submarine was about Kanata regaining control from Keito (via Souma). This future event would be about Keito granting Kanata’s wish under Kanata’s control as repayment.</p>
