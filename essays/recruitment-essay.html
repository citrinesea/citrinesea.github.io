     <div class="essaybox">
     <div class="question">
<p><b>How were Souma, Midori, Tetora and Shinobu recruited?</b></p></div>

     <div class="essay">
<p>As a refresher, RYUSEITAI is one of Yumenosaki's oldest units. Chiaki's RYUSEITAI was formed in Meteor Impact when the delinquent RYUSEITAI members ditch Chiaki and Kanata after the Battle of the Sea God. AKATSUKI was formed after the events of Crossroad.</p>

<b><p>Souma's recruitment</b></p>

<p>Souma and Keito have known each other even before Crossroad: Souma's a trouble maker. Still, Keito sees his potential.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>If he were properly produced, he’d become an interesting idol, wouldn’t he?
</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Crossroad (citrinesea)</p></div>

<p>Souma is there to witness Keito perform at DEADMANZ Live.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>Also… Hasumi-dono, who I deeply respect, looks to be standing on stage. I have never seen that personage sing before, so I’m quite interested.</p></div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>His voice is clear, and yet solid and beautiful. Ah, it feels good to the ear.</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Crossroad (citrinesea)</p></div>

<p>Kuro and Keito decide to form a unit together. When Souma catches wind of it, he pursues it relentlessly.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>In any case, Kanzaki, I have told you many times that Akatsuki is nothing like you imagine [...] You should thrive in another unit that suits your strengths: join one or make another.</p></div>
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SOUMA</b>
</div>
<div class="soumaquote"><p>No. A sword may not choose its wielder, but I want to become an idol under you, Hasumi-dono [...] Now come! Give me the entry test again!</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Shinsengumi (kotofucious)</p></div>

<p>At Kuro's suggestion, Keito gives in and allows Souma into AKATSUKI.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>I understand your point, Kiryu. I see there is no other choice. It's true we are in need of help, and I do want to develop Kanzaki's talent.</p></div>
<div class="keitoquote"><p>[...] I accept your admission, Kanzaki. Welcome to AKATSUKI.</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Shinsengumi (kotofucious)</p></div>


<b><p>Midori's recruitment</b></p>
<p>Midori accidentally entered the idol course.</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>[...] It was only by mistake that I took the idol course in the first place... Then I somehow managed to pass it, and in the end I had no choice to go to this academy.</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Climax (310mc)</p></div>

<p>Given his attitude, Midori's recruitment might seem surprisingly easy: he simply went with the flow.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>As soon as I entered the school, Morisawa-senpai came to my classroom and said stuff like “Ossu! I’m Morisawa Chiaki, the captain of the Basketball club! And, starting today, you’re a member of said club! Nice to meet you!”<p></div>

<div class="midoriquote"><p>He forced me to join, and turning him down would be a pain and all…</p></div>

<div class="midoriquote"><p>And I thought maybe he’d stop chasing me to my classroom if I joined the Basketball club, so I felt relieved for a second…</p></div>

<div class="midoriquote"><p>But then he was like “Takamine, won’t you become a hero? You’ve got the qualities of a hero! There is no mistake, you’re meant to be!”</p></div>

<div class="midoriquote"><p>So I ended up joining Ryuseitai too…</p></div></div>

<b><p>Shinobu's recruitment</b></p>

<p>Shinobu was recruited around the same time as Midori.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>SHINOBU</b>
</div>
<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Taichou-dono invited me, asking if I wanted to become a hero.)</p></div>

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(Well, at first I got scared of how close Taichou-dono was to me and thoughtlessly ran away.)</p></div>

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(But he appeared wherever I went and invited me each time, so I ended up nodding and accepting his offer.)</p></div>

<div class="shinobuquote"><p>(So, surprisingly enough, I quickly decided which unit I wanted to join.)</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Sparkly First Years (meatball124)</p></div>

<b><p>Tetora's recruitment</b></p>
<p>As he did with Midori and Shinobu, Chiaki had his eyes on Tetora early on.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>No, I don’t know… Huh…? Then, another unhappy first year is going to become your victim…?</p></div>
<div class="midoriquote">
<p>Being a member of this stupid group is super pitiful…<p></div>
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote">
<p>Don’t say that. There’s a kid called Nagumo Tetora in your class, right? I invited him, and now I’m waiting for him to respond.</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"><p>My hero sensors detected him! If that kid joins us, Ryuseitai will officially have five members! I’m really happy, mmhmhmm ♪</p>
</div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Sparkly First Years (meatball124)</p></div>

<p>However, Tetora auditioned for AKATSUKI first. After his rejection, Kuro guided him to Chiaki.</p>


<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote">
<p>A man among men is someone like Morisawa. Someone who draws close the weak, protects them, and loves them. Become like him, like a hero of justice who appears in stories... A cool guy.</p>
</div>
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>TETORA</b>
</div>
<div class="tetoraquote">
<p>Is that why you introduced me to RYUSEITAI?</p>
</div>
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KURO</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote">
<p>I don't mind if you think so. Morisawa instead of me: RYUSEITAI instead of AKATSUKI.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>CHIAKI</b>
</div>
<div class="chiakiquote">
<p>Remember how I said there was a kid I’d invited to Ryuseitai? Nagumo-kun has officially contacted me, saying he would join! Thus, we’re finally five people!</p>
</div>
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote"><p>Ah, poor thing… Nagumo-kun couldn’t escape Morisawa-senpai’s pushy invitations either… My condolences…</p></div></div>
