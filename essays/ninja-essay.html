<div class="question"><p>What are Keito and Chiaki's connections to Shinobu and ninjas?</p></div>
<p><b></b></p>
<div class="disclaimer">
<p><i>Originally asked on retrospring</i></p>
<p><b>anon:</b> UM I FEEL DUMB BUT, I saw your sketch of shinobu with keito and chiaki and the caption made me so happy.. I wondered what their connection is to shinobu and ninjas? I haven't read a lot of stories yet, but I love shinobu <333</p></div>

     <div class="essay">
       <p>you're not dumb anon! I just like to take any connection that tethers them together and run with it. I love Shinobun too!!</p>

<p><b>Starting the Ninja Association</b></p>
<p>In his first weeks at Yumenosaki, Shinobu aims to start the Ninja Association. Thanks to his new leader's encouragement, he takes steps to make it happen.</p>

<div class="shinobuquote">
<p>I have summoned a lot of courage! Hehehe. This is also thanks to Taichou-dono! When I wasn't sure whether I should start the Ninja Association or not, he encouraged me, saying "if you want to do it, then go do it!"</p></div> 
<div class="shinobuquote">
<p>If he hadn't lectured me like that, I would probably be dying in fear right now!</p></div></div>

<p><b>Ninja Senpai</b></p>
<p>In Scroll of the Elements, Shinobu brings up a potential gig for a joint live performance between Akatsuki and Ryuseitai. Chiaki leads the charge in convincing Keito to take it on and make it into a proposal. Keito does so and praises Shinobu for running the Ninja Association on his own.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote">
<p>It seems you are sponsoring the Ninja Association or such, aren’t you? You are the master of your own house. Be more resolute. Isara was worried, you know. Although club activities are gatherings for hobbies, strive at it without reserve.</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Scroll of the Elements (Looks after rainbows)</p></div>

<p>After the events of Scrolls, Keito grows interested in Shinobu as (a) a member of Broadcasting Committee (centralized information) and (b) a member of the Student Council. To keep tabs on Mao, Keito employs him as a secret emissary.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KEITO</b>
</div>
<div class="keitoquote">
<p>At first, I asked Sengoku if he could do it, considering I’ve been getting him to keep me regularly updated on how the Student Council is doing, as I tend to worry about Isara as the president.</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Submarine (310mc)</p></div>

<p>In Submarine, Keito asks Shinobu to fulfill the same duty. However, Shinobu refers him to Chiaki instead: Chiaki's secret order makes it easier to be discreet.</p>

<div class="shinobuquote">
<p>Alright, so… We began sharing information with Akatsuki after forming a common front. At first, I was the one who was asked to be the mediator, but this time around, Morisawa-dono was much more convenient for the role, so I requested that he do it in my stead.</p></div>

<p>Yup! I was Ninja-man, who went around Okinawa gathering information and passing it on to the right people!</p></div>

<p>I’m not playing with him… Though I do think I should reward Sengoku sooner or later for acting as my subordinate.</p></div>

<p>I recall him saying he’s simply returning the favor you did for him in Scroll of the Elements, so don’t worry about it.</p></div>

<p>And Shinobu’s not the only lonely one of the three.</p>

<div class="chiakiquote">
<p>Ah, no. I just happened to see them yesterday, that’s all. I ended up mentioning how bored I was, and Sengoku invited me to hang out.</p></div>
<div class="chiakiquote"> 
<p>He also had free time for similar reasons as mine, so he was more than happy to spend time together. Hehe, looks like I was holding back more than necessary.</p></div>

<p>It’s really cute that they both indulge him, and I just find it special Shinobu has senpai who look after him and empower his interests. Post-Submarine, I like to imagine Chiaki trails after them like "how are you doing, fellow ninja? (:" [seeking connection with his kouhai and companionship with the two of them].</p>

<p>I've trained so much, but a lot of the jutsus still ended in failure... It's kind of depressing, but at least the Jutsu of Summoning I tried in the past was a success... "May I make friends", I said.</p></div></div>
