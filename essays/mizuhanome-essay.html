<p><b>anon:</b> i wanna see more manga club keito or mizuhanome sensei, im curious~üëÄ midori being in manga club is also a bonus but not mandatory. it's just amusing to me as an anime otaku that keito can draw doujins & is interested in manga</p></div>

     <div class="essay">
       <p>As a Keito-is-Midori‚Äôs-AKATSUKI-senpai truther, thank you for giving me an excuse to talk about them.</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="keitoquote"><p>Otaku is a compliment.</p></div></div>

<p><b>Mizuhanome-sensei</b></p>
<p>When I first started getting into Enstars lore I was like ‚Äúwho the hell is Mizuhanome, where can I find more?‚Äù</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="otherquote"><p>He would read me books, or tell me made up stories. I was always thrilled to hear them‚Ä¶ He often drew me pictures, too. They are all my treasures.</p></div></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Quarrel Festival</p></div>

<p>Before attending Yumenosaki, Keito wanted to become a mangaka. Mizuhanome-sensei is the pen name Keito uses for his doujinshi. It‚Äôs Keito worst-kept secret, but he still attempts to keep it discreet for the sake of Akatsuki‚Äôs image (Philosopher's Guidance)</p>

<p>In !-era, Keito draws posters for events around campus and keeps up his manga as a hobby. He has an eye for graphic design and data visualization (Philosopher‚Äôs Guidance). He‚Äôs more familiar with traditional art than digital. (Philosopher‚Äôs Guidance, Scroll of the Elements). Anzu is his biggest fan, constantly letting his secret slip out to others. Her art style resembles Keito‚Äôs (Tea Party).</p>

<p>One known work of his is "Wonderland Alice VS. Looking Glass Alice" ("‚ÄúA fairy tale of love and excitement‚Ä¶" - Eichi). It's unfinished, so Eichi entrusts Anzu to finish drawing the rest (Tea Party). Mizuhanome has written text-only fanfiction for a discontinued series (Biblio) and has a fanart book (Mission of the Spy).</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="otherquote">
<p>Stories with mentions of Mizuhanome include:</p>
<p>Quarrel Festival (!), Tea Party (!), Comic World (!), Philosopher‚Äôs Guidance (!), Biblio (!), Scroll of the Elements (!), Mission of the Spy (!!), Yuzuru FS1 (!!), To Want Even the Help of the Emperor (Eichi) (!!). Souma also mentions him in Colorful Autumn (!).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Midori and Manga</b></p>
<p>Midori‚Äôs taste in manga is a little broader than his love for mascots (Manga Club, A Detour Encounter). He and Mao read American comics in A Normal Day (!).</p>

<p><b>Midori and Artists</b></p>
<p>Midori's behavior towards different artists in ES lies along a spectrum depending on how skillful the artist is and how close he is with them.</p>

<p>1) He quietly admires Keito‚Äôs art but is distant because of their unfamiliarity with each other (Scroll of the Elements)</p>
<p>2) He‚Äôs affectionate towards cute art styles (Shinobu, Souma, Kanata) (Shinobu FS2, Ninja Clan, Colorful Autumn)</p>
<p>3) He‚Äôs really affectionate and intense when it comes to cutesy surrealism‚Äì aka people who aren‚Äôt so good at drawing (Yuzuru, Tetora) (Yuzuru FS1, Colorful Autumn).</p>

<p>Anzu fluctuates between 2 and 3, depending on whether she draws normally or caters to Midori‚Äôs interests. Please read Colorful Autumn. I beg of you, it's hilarious.</p>


<p><b>Midori and Keito</b></p>
<p>In Scroll of Elements (!), Keito and Midori are the first to arrive at their gig. To ease the atmosphere, Keito uses Midori‚Äôs mascot merch as a reference for the pamphlets he‚Äôs drawing. When Keito takes the lead on their studies for the Manga Quiz in Manga Club (!!), he settles Midori‚Äôs nerves with encouragement and flatters his strengths afterward.</p>
<p>If it interests you, the stage play adaptation of Pirate Festival (Extra Stage ~Destruction √ó Road) retcons the lore of Captain Kidoairaku (the mascot Midori becomes infatuated with) so that Keito is its creator.</p>
