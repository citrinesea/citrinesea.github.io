<h3><b>Mizuhanome-sensei</b></h3>
<hr></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>When I first started getting into Enstars lore I was like ‚Äúwho the hell is Mizuhanome, where can I find more?‚Äù</p></div>

<div class="quote">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>EICHI</b>
</div>
<div class="otherquote"><p>He would read me books, or tell me made up stories. I was always thrilled to hear them‚Ä¶ He often drew me pictures, too. They are all my treasures.</p></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>!-Era | ‚òÄÔ∏é Summer | Quarrel Festival (dreamyproject)</p></div></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Before attending Yumenosaki, Keito wanted to become a mangaka. Mizuhanome-sensei is the pen name Keito uses for his doujinshi. It‚Äôs Keito worst-kept secret, but he still attempts to keep it discreet for the sake of Akatsuki‚Äôs image (Philosopher's Guidance)</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>In !-era, Keito draws posters for events around campus and keeps up his manga as a hobby. He has an eye for graphic design and data visualization (Philosopher‚Äôs Guidance). He‚Äôs more familiar with traditional art than digital. (Philosopher‚Äôs Guidance, Scroll of the Elements).</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Anzu is his biggest fan, constantly letting his secret slip out to others. Her art style resembles Keito‚Äôs (Tea Party).</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>One known work of his is "Wonderland Alice VS. Looking Glass Alice" ("‚ÄúA fairy tale of love and excitement‚Ä¶" - Eichi). It's unfinished, so Eichi entrusts Anzu to finish drawing the rest (Tea Party). Mizuhanome has written text-only fanfiction for a discontinued series (Biblio) and has a fanart book (Mission of the Spy).</p></div>

<div class="TOSsquare">
<p><b>Stories with mentions of Mizuhanome include:</b></p>
<p>Quarrel Festival (!), Tea Party (!), Comic World (!), Philosopher‚Äôs Guidance (!), Biblio (!), Scroll of the Elements (!), Mission of the Spy (!!), Yuzuru FS1 (!!), To Want Even the Help of the Emperor (Eichi) (!!). Souma also mentions him in Colorful Autumn (!).</p></div>

<h3><b>Midori and Manga</b></h3>
<hr></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Midori‚Äôs taste in manga is a little more broad than his love for mascots (Manga Club, A Detour Encounter). He and Mao read American comics in A Normal Day (!).</p></div>

<h3><b>Midori and Artists</b></h3>
<hr></div>
<div class="essay-analysis"><p>Midori's behavior towards different artists in ES lies along a spectrum depending on how skillful the artist is and how close he is with them.</p></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p><b>1)</b> He quietly admires Keito‚Äôs art but is distant because of their unfamiliarity with each other (Scroll of the Elements)</p></div>

<h3><b>Midori and Keito</b></h3>
<hr></div>

<div class="essay-analysis"><p>In Scroll of Elements (!), Keito and Midori are the first to arrive at their gig. To ease the atmosphere, Keito uses Midori‚Äôs mascot merch as a reference for the pamphlets he‚Äôs drawing. When Keito takes the lead on their studies for the Manga Quiz in Manga Club (!!), he settles Midori‚Äôs nerves with encouragement and flatters his strengths afterward.</p></div>

<div class="TOSsquare">
<p><b>Fun fact</b> The stage play adaptation of Pirate Festival <i>(Extra Stage ~Destruction √ó Road)</i> retcons the lore of Captain Kidoairaku (the mascot Midori becomes infatuated with) so that Keito is its creator.</p></div>
