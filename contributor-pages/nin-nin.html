<p><b>TRANSLATION PLANS</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<p><b>Explain yourself Rin.</b></p>
<p> For starters, I'll likely never call myself a translator, it's not my occupation nor expertise: I just do translations.</p>
<p>I took Japanese in undergraduate school and I honestly miss it. It was fun learning a language I could <i>actually</i> get good at, over other languages like Spanish (sweats in second-gen). My main goals with translating are (a) to keep up practice and start getting better again and (b) have a personal library of AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI stories that I love and can keep. The thing about games like Enstars is that they'll end one day. If I can archive it for myself, with my own skillset, I'll feel happy. Translators do thankless work for the community: they're very key to preservation and accessibility.</p>
<p> I missed out on my first Enstars phase in high school because I just didn't know where to start. I listened to the music, thought it was cool (RSTAKTK for years), but I didn't read stories, didn't know how to download the game. Even now, the only reason I can engage with the lore so intensely is because of translators like 310mc who just make things <i>accessible</i>. It's taken for granted what websites like that can do for people, so I wanted to have one of my own -- both for me and maybe for others if they can find it useful.</p> 
<p>Everything happens for a reason (if I had to deal with Meteor Impact in 2019 I would simply perish bahaha), which is why now I want to do that teen me justice. Building this website and translating even the smallest things makes me feel accomplished, and if it even convinces one person to see what's so wonderful about RYUSEITAI and AKATSUKI I'll be so happy.</p>
<p>Anyways. My translation plans.</p>
<p>• <b>First and foremost</b> I have both the AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI Ensemble Stars Magazines (2017). My main priority will be getting the AKATSUKI one done first. To be honest, I really doubt I'll do the RYUSEITAI one myself (handing it over to the pro, bahaha), but at the very least I'll be doing the cute quizzes from it.</p>
<p>These !-Era magazines have character profiles, interviews, maps, relationship charts -- SO MUCH, so it'll keep me busy and help me shake off the rust, as well as get used to translating different characters' voices (Souma, Shinobu, Tetora, Kuro I'm looking at you).</p>
<p>• <b>Management stories</b> These are from Enstars Basic. I feel like it'll be a good way to do small translations (and not just skip through them when they pop up bahaha).</p>
<p>• <b>Short idol stories</b> Especially from !-Era. There's a lot of lore hidden in one-chapter idol stories (Souma and Shinobu meeting for the first time, etc.) and I want to pry it out. They're smaller chunks to work with, but they're also more long than entries in a magazine. After I have some practice, I'll work on these.</p>
<p>• <b>Big Kahuna</b> My pipe dream, my dream goal, my bucket list: one day, I want to translate Scroll of the Elements. It's a story that just means so much to me with these two units, and really reaffirmed my love for them <b>together</b>. I'm nowhere near ready now, but one day, I want that to be the story I do.</p>
<p>I hope that they can be useful to anyone who finds them.</p>
