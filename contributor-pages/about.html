     <div class="aboutTOS">
   
<p>Welcome to my website! The goal of <i>citrinesea</i> is to house the polished versions of my thoughts and theories I have about different iterations of Ryuseitai and Akatsuki. Additionally, I also have lore written down with its sources, so the next time I go "when did that happen?" I actually have a clean space to sift through.</p>

<div class="category">

<p><b>MISSION STATEMENT & TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></p></div></div>

<p>This website is <b>non-profit</b>. At most, it's an aesthetic database of my delusions of grandeur. </p>

<div class="TOSsquare"> <b>Accessibility</b> 

<p>I want this website to be what I wish I had when I started out: a place to easily find credible lore and information about Ryuseitai and Akatsuki.</p>
<p>To support the credibility of information on this website, quotes and explanations are cited thoroughly. If a thread catches your interest, you should be able to find which story it's located in.</p></div>

<div class="TOSsquare">
<b>Citation and attribution</b> 
<p>More importantly, credit is attributed to translators directly. Their work is tireless.</p> 

<p><b>My citation format is built off of the considerations of each translator's terms of service</b>. In the case that a translator does not want their work reposted, I have translated the original lines to use within the essay, but have credited their full translations for where to find the story.</p> 

<p>It is always best to go to the original source, and I highly encourage that above all else. If you happen to use this website for its quotes, <b>please</b> screenshot with the citation attached. Each quote has one listed beneath it.</p> 

<p>Below is an example of what should be included for it to be <b>proper attribution</b>:</p>

<div class="TOSsquare">
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>MIDORI</b>
</div>
<div class="midoriquote">
<p>I had no idea that Hasumi-senpai can be as persistent as Morisawa-senpai… We barely had anything to do with Akatsuki outside of Scroll of the Elements so…</p></div>
<div class="quotelabel">
<b>KANATA</b>
</div>
<div class="kanataquote">
<p>fufu. We have a bit of history between us and Akatsuki, after all. perhaps that made us ‘Avoid’ each other.</p></div>
<div class="citationtext">
<p>Submarine (310mc)</p></div></div>
<div class="note"><i>Include name of story and translator</i></div>

<p></p>
<b>I reiterate that it is best to go to the original source</b>, so I have made that process as easy as possible.

</div>

<p>If you have any questions about the website, you can ask them on my <a href="https://retrospring.net/@citrinesea">retrospring</a>.</p> 

<p>If at anytime a contributor or translator wants their work taken down it's 100% do-able: just contact me at citrinesea.io@gmail.com or in DMs (@citrinesea).</p>

<p><b>CONTRIBUTORS</b></p></div></div>

<p>I have also opened this space for other contributors to submit and house their pieces on lore and analysis.</p> 

<div class="TOSsquare">
<p> • This website focuses on Ryuseitai and Akatsuki <b>only</b>. With few exceptions (i.e. Madara), discussion on other characters should be limited.</p>
<p> • I manually approve and format analyses for release. However, <b>opinions and analysis belong to the contributor who wrote it.</b></p>
<p> • <b>All contributors</b> (current and future) are held to the citation standard I hold for myself, and are provided a style guide for citations.</p></div>

Submissions for contribution are currently <b>closed</b>.

<p>The written pieces on this website are color-coded by the author. Click on a profile below to explore a contributor's analyses.</p>
