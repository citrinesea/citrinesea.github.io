<div class="line"></div>

<p>So this’ll be long, but I prefer to infodump about each one because I like being thorough (and for reference next time I forget where a line comes from). I think it’s important to be able to source stories, so hopefully it inspires you to check out the full ones for yourselves!</p>

<p>Sections are divided by RST members, and subsections are Akatsuki members. I’ll give a sort of spoiler-free summary, and then the characters each story is relevant to. I also have an accompanying graphic that I’ll post. It’ll make this look a lot more organized.</p>

<p><b>Ryuseitai and Akatsuki</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<p>If you want a comprehensive look at Ryuseitai and Akatsuki as a whole, Meteor Impact, Scroll of the Elements, and Submarine are must-reads. They’re way longer than the individual character story recommendations below, but they are mandatory if you want to understand both units.</p>

<div class="story-desc">
<p>Meteor Impact</p>
<p><b>Pre-War ☀︎ Summer</b></p></div></div>
<p>In short, Meteor Impact is the origin story for pre-war Ryuseitai (Madara and Chiaki), the student council (Keito and Chiaki), Akatsuki’s role in the war (Keito, Kuro, Souma), and the reason for Kanata’s entire subjugation + Battle of the Sea God (Akatsuki v. Kanata). It also covers Kanzaki-Shinkai relations (Souma and Kanata) and why Kuro has a heavy hand in RST Live Shows (Kuro and Chiaki). The war-era part of this story ends with Chiaki and Kanata being what’s left of RST, until the 1st years (Noritama) come in the spring.</p>
<p>The story spans all three years of Yumenosaki !-era. There are highly sensitive themes and it’s a very heavy read, so be mindful of the disclaimers before you give it a look.</p>

<p>Scroll of the Elements</p>
<p><b>!-Era ❦ Autumn</b></p></div></div>

<p>This is a big story for AKTK+RST post-Meteor Impact (timeline-wise), as they perform at a local tourist spot. I’ll go into some detail below when we get to what this means for some individual characters, but it’s a great story for Souma and Shinobu, and there are notable moments for Souma and RST, and Keito and Midori. It’s more slice of life-adjacent than Meteor Impact is, so it’s a lighter read!</p>

<p>Submarine</p>
<p><b>!!-Era ❆ Winter</b></p></div></div>
<p>Submarine takes place in !!-era, during the SS Arc. This is AKTK+RST’s third major story together, and it pulls together elements from both Meteor Impact and Scrolls. Akatsuki and Ryuseitai travel to Okinawa during the SS Tournament, and face war on the island with local idols. Because of secret orders, Akatsuki is led by Souma and Ryuseitai is led (indirectly) by Kanata. This is story reconstructs AKTK+RST’s relationship going forward</p>

	<p>Crossroad</p>

	<p>Combined with Meteor Impact, Crossroads is a good exploration of 2nd-years Chiaki and Keito. Keito grows an intrigue with Chiaki (specifically, the difference between his actions and his timid personality).</p>

	<p>Keito and Chiaki tend to favor bigger stories for interactions, so if you’re looking for more, (War Era) Meteor Impact, (!-era) Scrolls and (!!-era) Submarine is where you’ll find it.</p>

	<p>Kuro needs help practicing for the filming of a school drama, and Chiaki takes the initiative to go and help! Alongside Tetora and Midori, this is Chiaki’s repayment to Kuro for all that he’s done for them. Chiaki, Kuro, Midori and Tetora practice lines for a script… and flop terribly. It’s amazing, this story is hilarious. Bonus points for Midori and Kuro’s first meeting as well.</p>

	<p>These two have a lot of history together, so Meteor Impact is a good story for how they met and how their relationship developed. Gang is another good one for them.</p>

	<p>Kanata enlists Kuro to help him tie up Kaoru’s surfboards during a typhoon, and Keito comes along. At the same time, Keito is trying to pin down who is releasing manga based on him, Kanata and the war. This story is incredibly key to understanding Kanata’s feelings about the War. It also illustrates his and Keito’s different philosophies on how they plan to move forward from it: the same path, but different methods).</p>

	<p><b>!-Era ❀ Spring</b></p></div></div>

	<p>Souma and Kanata are very entwined– childhood acquaintances, doomed roles to each other, etc. There’s a handful of stories that you could read to understand them in their full context. Here, I’ll recommend Palace of the Ocean. Souma becomes enamored with a turtle and spends the story taking good care of it. The last few chapters set a good baseline for Kanata and Souma’s interactions: if you read Submarine and were confused as to why Kanata is so comfortable terrorizing Souma, this is a good answer.</p>

	<p>For extra RST+AKTK goodness, read Crash Course, a faux unit swap story. It’s a close second to my recommendation list, and you get to see AKTK!Kanata and RST!Souma. Colorful Autumn is good for their slice of life dynamic too.</p>

	<p>Akatsuki puts on an opera, and Tetora jumps at the opportunity to be a part of it. At the same time, he grapples with his intimidation of Keito after having been rejected from Akatsuki. This story has a big breakthrough for the preparation of that tension, as Keito and Tetora tentatively prod around each other more personally.</p>

	<p>Okay. This story transformed me for real.</p>

	<p>If you’re looking for a deep dive on Akatsuki lore and Tetora’s involvement in all of it, it’s here. What Supervillain!Tetora was to Chiaki is what Four Beasts!Tetora is to Kuro. This is the precedent to elevating Tetora’s senpai-worship/Kuro’s mentorship relationship. If you want to understand Tetora and Kuro at an atomic level, this is your story.</p>

	<p>Besides that, it goes into how Tetora found RST post-Akatsuki rejection, the Dragon King Festival, and even why the Student Council broke it up during the Main Story.<p>
