<p><b>PREFACE</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<p>A) THANK YOU I'M OBSESSED WITH THEM I'M HAPPY MY RAMBLES ARE SOMEWHAT COHERENT they all mean so much to me, they‚Äôre so colorful and fun and tragic and‚Ä¶ they are so special‚Ä¶ not biased (biased) but they are the best, and the fact that they have such long, extensive lore is so fun. Each story has so much to unpack, and reveals more of past stories. I‚Äôm obsessed.</p>
<p>B) I'M HAPPY YOU ASKED! I have a place to put this now.</p>

<p>So this‚Äôll be long, but I prefer to infodump about each one because I like being thorough (and for reference next time I forget where a line comes from). I think it‚Äôs important to be able to source stories, so hopefully it inspires you to check out the full ones for yourselves! Most of these can be found on the wiki or by the translator 310mc. If you‚Äôre looking for RST stories and content, I highly recommend their blog ( https://310mc.github.io/ ), seriously, it‚Äôs a library of alexandria, incredibly accessible in its formatting and Akatsuki makes enough appearances in RST stories that you can get a lot of good Akatsuki content from them as well.</p>

<p>Sections are divided by RST members, and subsections are Akatsuki members. I‚Äôll give a sort of spoiler-free summary, and then the characters each story is relevant to. I also have an accompanying graphic that I‚Äôll post. It‚Äôll make this look a lot more organized.</p>

<div class="labelcategory">
<p><b>Ryuseitai and Akatsuki</b></p></div>
<div class="line"></div>

<p>If you want a comprehensive look at Ryuseitai and Akatsuki as a whole, Meteor Impact, Scroll of the Elements, and Submarine are must-reads. They‚Äôre way longer than the individual character story recommendations below, but they are mandatory if you want to understand both units.</p>

<div class="story-desc">
<p>Meteor Impact</p>
<p><b>Pre-War ‚òÄÔ∏é Summer</b></p></div></div>
<p>In short, Meteor Impact is the origin story for pre-war Ryuseitai (Madara and Chiaki), the student council (Keito and Chiaki), Akatsuki‚Äôs role in the war (Keito, Kuro, Souma), and the reason for Kanata‚Äôs entire subjugation + Battle of the Sea God (Akatsuki v. Kanata). It also covers Kanzaki-Shinkai relations (Souma and Kanata) and why Kuro has a heavy hand in RST Live Shows (Kuro and Chiaki). The war-era part of this story ends with Chiaki and Kanata being what‚Äôs left of RST, until the 1st years (Noritama) come in the spring.</p>
<p>The story spans all three years of Yumenosaki !-era. There are highly sensitive themes and it‚Äôs a very heavy read, so be mindful of the disclaimers before you give it a look.</p>

<div class="story-desc">
<p>Scroll of the Elements</p>
<p><b>!-Era ‚ù¶ Autumn</b></p></div></div>

<p>This is a big story for AKTK+RST post-Meteor Impact (timeline-wise), as they perform at a local tourist spot. I‚Äôll go into some detail below when we get to what this means for some individual characters, but it‚Äôs a great story for Souma and Shinobu, and there are notable moments for Souma and RST, and Keito and Midori. It‚Äôs more slice of life-adjacent than Meteor Impact is, so it‚Äôs a lighter read!</p>

<div class="story-thumbnail">
	<img
            src="../images/reading-recc-thumbnails/submarine.jpg"
            alt="Submarine."></div>

<div class="story-desc">
<p>Submarine</p>
<p><b>!!-Era ‚ùÜ Winter</b></p></div></div>
<p>Submarine takes place in !!-era, during the SS Arc. This is AKTK+RST‚Äôs third major story together, and it pulls together elements from both Meteor Impact and Scrolls. Akatsuki and Ryuseitai travel to Okinawa during the SS Tournament, and face war on the island with local idols. Because of secret orders, Akatsuki is led by Souma and Ryuseitai is led (indirectly) by Kanata. This is story reconstructs AKTK+RST‚Äôs relationship going forward</p>


<p>OKAY, are you still with me? Here are individual character dynamics. Obviously some (Kanasou, Tetokuro) will have more than others (Chisou, Tetokei), but my priority on picking these ones are (a) shorter (b) lighter (c) tell, don‚Äôt show (sometimes it‚Äôs just easier when the story TELLS you what you need to know about characters). I‚Äôll include extra story recommendations if you want to jump off into individual dynamics, but these are just my personal favorite tasty little reads.</p>

<p>I tried to avoid doubling up on this list, but at the same time, it‚Äôs helpful knocking out more than one pairing with different stories. Hopefully there‚Äôs enough variety to make up for it!</p>

	<p>Crossroad</p>
	<p><b>Pre-War ‚òÄÔ∏é Summer</b></p></div></div>
	<p>Combined with Meteor Impact, Crossroads is a good exploration of 2nd-years Chiaki and Keito. Keito grows an intrigue with Chiaki (specifically, the difference between his actions and his timid personality).</p>

	<p>Keito and Chiaki tend to favor bigger stories for interactions, so if you‚Äôre looking for more, (War Era) Meteor Impact, (!-era) Scrolls and (!!-era) Submarine is where you‚Äôll find it.</p>

	<p>Kuro needs help practicing for the filming of a school drama, and Chiaki takes the initiative to go and help! Alongside Tetora and Midori, this is Chiaki‚Äôs repayment to Kuro for all that he‚Äôs done for them. Chiaki, Kuro, Midori and Tetora practice lines for a script‚Ä¶ and flop terribly. It‚Äôs amazing, this story is hilarious. Bonus points for Midori and Kuro‚Äôs first meeting as well.</p>

	<p>These two have a lot of history together, so Meteor Impact is a good story for how they met and how their relationship developed. Gang is another good one for them.</p>

	<p>Souma and Chiaki don‚Äôt have much facetime together, but do interact a lot during Scrolls, when Souma heads the effort in getting Shinobu‚Äôs proposal through Keito. They think highly of each other ‚Äì highlighted in Submarine!</p>

	<p>Kanata enlists Kuro to help him tie up Kaoru‚Äôs surfboards during a typhoon, and Keito comes along. At the same time, Keito is trying to pin down who is releasing manga based on him, Kanata and the war. This story is incredibly key to understanding Kanata‚Äôs feelings about the War. It also illustrates his and Keito‚Äôs different philosophies on how they plan to move forward from it: the same path, but different methods).</p>

	<p>Souma and Kanata are very entwined‚Äì childhood acquaintances, doomed roles to each other, etc. There‚Äôs a handful of stories that you could read to understand them in their full context. Here, I‚Äôll recommend Palace of the Ocean. Souma becomes enamored with a turtle and spends the story taking good care of it. The last few chapters set a good baseline for Kanata and Souma‚Äôs interactions: if you read Submarine and were confused as to why Kanata is so comfortable terrorizing Souma, this is a good answer.</p>
